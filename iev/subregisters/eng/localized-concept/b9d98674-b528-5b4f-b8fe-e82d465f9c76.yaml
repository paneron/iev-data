  definition: the radius of an ideal spherical Earth without atmosphere for which
    propagation paths are along straight lines, the heights and ground distances being
    the same as for the actual Earth in an atmosphere with a constant vertical gradient
    of refractivity

  notes:
  - The concept of effective radius of the Earth implies that the angles with the
    horizontal planes made at all points by the transmission paths are not too large.
  - For an atmosphere having a standard refractivity gradient, the effective radius
    of the Earth is taken as equal to 8500 km, which corresponds approximately to
    4/3 of the actual radius of the Earth.
