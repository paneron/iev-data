  definition: density of incident radiant energy with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface `H_e = ((d Q_e))/((d A))` where `Q`~e~ is radiant
    energy and `A` is the area on which the radiant energy is incident

  notes:
  - The quantity "radiant exposure" defined here must not be confused with the quantity
    named "exposure" which is used in the field of X- and γ-rays, the unit of which
    is coulomb per kilogram (C·kg^−1^).
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous exposure". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exposure".
  - The radiant exposure is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^ = W·s·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-42 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
