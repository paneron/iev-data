  definition: mean value of the {{joint information content, IEV:171-07-20}} of the
    events in a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events `H
    ( X , Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p ( x_i , y_j ) * I ( x_i , y_j )`
    where `X = { x_1 , ... , x_n }` is the set of events `x_i ( i = 1, ... , n )`,
    `Y = { y_1 , ... , y_m }` is the set of events `y_j ( j = 1, ... , m )`, `I (
    x_i , y_j )` is the joint information content of `x_i` and `y_j`, and `p ( x_i
    , y_j )` the joint probability that both events occur
