  notes:
  - 'This phase noise is normally expressed as the power spectral density of the phase
    fluctuations, `S_(varphi) ( f )`, where the phase fluctuation function is `varphi
    ( t ) = 2 pi F t - 2 pi F_0 t`. The spectral density of phase fluctuation can
    be directly related to the spectral density of frequency fluctuation by the following
    formula:


    `S_(varphi) ( f ) = ( ((F_0))/(f) ) S_y ( f ) rad^2 //Hz`


    In the preceding formulae:


    `F` is the oscillator frequency;


    `F`~0~ is the average oscillator frequency;


    `f` is the Fourier frequency.'
