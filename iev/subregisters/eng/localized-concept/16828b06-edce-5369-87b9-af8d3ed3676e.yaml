  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the heat transfer by natural
    convection in a fluid, defined by `G r = ((l^3 g alpha_V Delta T))/((nu^2))`,
    where `l` is a specified length, `g` is acceleration of free fall, `α`~`V`~ is
    cubic expansion coefficient, Δ`T` is thermodynamic temperature difference, and
    `ν` is kinematic viscosity
