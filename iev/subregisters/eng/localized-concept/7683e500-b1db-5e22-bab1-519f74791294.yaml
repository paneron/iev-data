  definition: number `k` in the expression `vartheta_0 - 2 pi ((( i - 1 ) k))/(m)`
    for the initial phase of quantity number `i` of the set of `m` quantities forming
    a symmetric polyphase system, where `vartheta_0` is the initial phase of one of
    the quantities which is arbitrarily chosen out of the set of `m` quantities, `i`
    is one of the integers 1, 2, ..., `m`, and `k` is a characteristic of the system,
    equal to one of the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., `m` âˆ’ 1
