  notes:
  - A balun is used, for example, to couple a balanced antenna to an unbalanced feed
    line.
  - The term is derived from "balanced to unbalanced transformer".
  - A balun may be realized in practice by using a transformer or a lumped parameter
    or distributed parameter network which may include active devices.
  - A balun may exhibit inherent impedance transformation differing from unity.
