  notes:
  - 1 The expectation value of spin in any direction is `ℏ sqrt(s ( s + 1 ))` where
    `s` is spin quantum number and `ħ` is reduced Planck constant.
  - 2 The spin in a given direction is quantized as multiples or half-multiples of
    the reduced Planck constant. In the direction of the quantization axis `z`, the
    component of the spin is quantized as `S`~`z`~ = `m`~`s`~`ħ`, `m`~`s`~ = `s`,
    `s` − 1, … − `s`, where `m`~`s`~ is spin magnetic quantum number and `s` is spin
    quantum number.
