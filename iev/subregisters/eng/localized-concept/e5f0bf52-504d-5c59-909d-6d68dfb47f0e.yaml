  definition: 'time response of a linear time-invariant system, which initially is
    in steady state `U`~0~, `V`~0~, produced by application of a step function Δ`u`~ε~(`t`)
    = `K`~ε~·ε(`t`) to one of the input variables, where Δ`v`~ε~(`t`) = `v`(`t`) –
    `V`~0~ and Δ`u`~ε~(`t`) = `u`(`t`) – `U`~0~ SEE: Figure 5.'

  notes:
  - The step response of a linear time-invariant system is proportional to the time
    integral of its impulse response.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-20 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
