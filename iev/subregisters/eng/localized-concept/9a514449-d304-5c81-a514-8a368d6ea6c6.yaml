  definition: 'three-dimensional, approximately uniform colour space produced by plotting
    in rectangular coordinates `U`*, `V`*, `W`*, quantities defined by the equations:
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">* `[[W^( * ) = 25 Y^(1 // 3) - 17],[U^( * )
    = 13 W^( * ) ( u - u_n )],[V^( * ) = 13 W^( * ) ( v - v_n )]]`'

  notes:
  - '`Y`, `u`, `v` describe the colour stimulus considered, and `u`~n~, `v`~n~ describe
    a specified white achromatic stimulus, where `u = u^( '' )`, `v = (2)/(3) v^(
    '' )`; `u_n^() = u_n^( '' )`, `v_n = (2)/(3) v_n^( '' )`.

  - "The difference between two stimuli, Î”`E`*, is defined as the Euclidean distance\
    \ between the points representing them in `U`*`V`*`W`* space and calculated as:\r\
    \n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">* `Delta E_()^* = ( Delta U_()^* )^2 + (\
    \ Delta V_()^* )^2 + ( Delta W_()^* )^2^(1 // 2)`."
  - The CIE 1964 uniform colour space is obsolete (except that it is still used in
    the calculation of the colour rendering index). The currently recommended object
    colour spaces are the <a href="IEV845-23-076">CIE 1976 L*a*b* colour space</a>
    and the <a href="IEV845-23-074">CIE 1976 L*u*v* colour space</a>.
