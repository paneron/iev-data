  definition: level in decibels equal to ten times the logarithm to the base ten of
    the ratio of the backscattering cross-section of the object to the spherical reference
    area of `4 pi r_0^2` where `r`~0~ is the reference distance, preferably chosen
    to be 1 m

  notes:
  - Whatever the reference area used, it shall be specified.
  - The object scattering differential for a designated direction other than backward
    is similarly defined.
  - Otherwise described, the object backscattering differential is the backscattered
    sound pressure level that would exist at the reference distance of `r`~0~ from
    the acoustic centre of the scattering object, minus the sound pressure level of
    a plane wave incident on the object.
  - 'Expressed in letter symbols, the definition reads:


    `N_((ts)) = L_((SC)) - L_i = 10 (log)_((10)) ((A_((ob))))/((4 pi r_0^2)) dB`


    where:


    `N`~ts~ is object backscattering differential or target strength


    `L`~SC~ is backscattered sound pressure level at reference distance


    `L`~i~ is incident sound pressure level


    `A`~ob~ is backscattering cross-section of object


    `r`~0~ is reference distance


    `4 pi r_0^2` is reference area for object backscattering differential.'
