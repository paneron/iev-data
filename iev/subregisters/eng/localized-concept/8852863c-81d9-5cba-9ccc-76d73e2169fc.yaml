  definition: surface wave associated with the free boundary of a solid or liquid
    such that a surface particle describes an ellipse whose major axis is normal to
    the surface, and whose centre is situated on the initially undisturbed surface

  notes:
  - At maximum particle displacement away from this initially undisturbed surface
    the motion of the particle is opposite to that of the wave.
  - The propagation velocity of a Rayleigh wave is slightly less than that of a shear
    wave in the solid. The wave amplitude of the Rayleigh wave diminishes exponentially
    with depth.
