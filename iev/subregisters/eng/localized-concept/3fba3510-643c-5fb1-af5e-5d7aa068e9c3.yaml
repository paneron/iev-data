  notes:
  - As the sum of the three chromaticity coordinates is equal to 1, two of them are
    sufficient to define a chromaticity.
  - In the CIE standard colorimetric systems, the chromaticity coordinates are represented
    by the symbols `x`, `y`, `z` or `x`~10~, `y`~10~, `z`~10~.
  - The chromaticity coordinates have unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-03-33 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
