  definition: the operation of two similar electronic tubes or of an equivalent double
    tube, in a circuit such that equal signal quantities in phase opposition are applied
    to the input electrodes, and the two outputs are combined in a single circuit
    to cancel the original fundamental input frequency. This facilitates frequency
    multiplication
