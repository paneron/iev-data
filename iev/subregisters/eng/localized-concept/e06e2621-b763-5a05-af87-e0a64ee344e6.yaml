  definition: for a given point of an oriented curve with an origin point, real number,
    the absolute value of which is the length of the curve between the origin and
    the given point, and the sign is positive or negative depending on whether the
    path from the origin to the given point is consistent or not with the orientation
    of the curve

  notes:
  - For a curve defined by the position vector `r = f ( u )` as a function of the
    parameter `u`, with an origin O corresponding to `u = 0`, the abscissa of the
    point M corresponding to `u` = `u`~M~ is the line integral `int_O^M | d r | =
    int_0^((u_M)) | ((d f))/((d u)) | d u`.
  - In the usual geometrical space, the abscissa along a curve is a quantity of the
    dimension length.
