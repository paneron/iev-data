  notes:
  - 1 The concept of acceleration of free fall may be used for any other astronomical
    object.
  - 2 The fall of a body in the atmosphere is also influenced by other effects such
    as Coriolis force and buoyancy. These additional effects are not taken into account
    in the definition of free fall acceleration.
