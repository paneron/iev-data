  definition: quotient of radiant energy and photon energy `N_p = ((Q_e))/((h nu))`
    where `Q`~e~ is radiant energy, `h` is the Planck constant, and `ν` is the {{frequency,
    IEV:103-06-02}} of the corresponding electromagnetic wave

  notes:
  - 'Photon number can also be expressed by the time integral of the photon flux,
    `Φ`~p~, over a given duration, Δ`t`:


    `N_p = int_((Delta t)) Phi_p d t`'
  - The photon number has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-29 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
