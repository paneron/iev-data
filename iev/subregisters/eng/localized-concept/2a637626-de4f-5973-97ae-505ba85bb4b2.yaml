  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the radiation intensity
    produced by an antenna in a given direction to the radiation intensity that would
    be obtained if the power accepted by the antenna were radiated equally in all
    directions

  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - If the antenna is lossless its absolute gain is equal to its directivity in the
    same direction.
