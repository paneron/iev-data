  notes:
  - '"15-supergroup assembly" is the only term in use by the CCITT.'
  - The French word "hypergroupe" or the English word "hypergroup" is sometimes used
    for a supergroup assembly different from that standardized by CCITT. Accordingly,
    this term should be qualified by the number of super-groups used in each application.
  - A 15-supergroup assembly is normally an assembly of 900 FDM telephone channels.
  - Signals, other than those derived from an assembly of supergroups but having specified
    characteristics, may occupy the whole or a part of a frequency band assigned to
    a 15-supergroup assembly.
