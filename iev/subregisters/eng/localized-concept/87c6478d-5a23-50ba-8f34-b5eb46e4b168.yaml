  definition: ratio of the luminous output of a source evaluated according to the
    CIE scotopic <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>, `V′`(`λ`),
    to the luminous output evaluated according to the CIE photopic spectral luminous
    efficiency, `V`(`λ`)

  notes:
  - 'The S/P ratio can be expressed by


    `R_((SP)) = ((K^( '' )_m int_0^(oo) S ( lambda ) V^( '' ) ( lambda ) d lambda))/((K_m
    int_0^(oo) S ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda))`


    where `K`′~m~ ≈ 1 700 lm·W^−1^ is the maximum luminous efficacy for scotopic vision,
    `K`~m~ ≈ 683 lm·W^−1^ is the maximum luminous efficacy for photopic vision, `S`(`λ`)
    is the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> of the source,
    and `λ` is the wavelength.'
  - The S/P ratio has unit one.
