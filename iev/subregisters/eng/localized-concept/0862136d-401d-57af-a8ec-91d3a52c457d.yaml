  definition: quotient of the initial value of a sudden change in that fundamental
    AC component of armature voltage, which is produced by the total quadrature-axis
    armature winding flux, and the value of the simultaneous change in fundamental
    AC component of quadrature-axis armature current, the machine running at rated
    speed and the high decrement components during the first cycles being excluded
