  notes:
  - An insulating aerial device may also be used to handle material if designed and
    equipped for that purpose.
  - An insulating aerial device does not include a chassis. When an insulating aerial
    device is mounted on a mobile chassis it becomes a component of a mobile elevating
    work platform (MEWP).
