  definition: level in decibels of the time integral of the antilogarithm of one-tenth
    of the tone-corrected perceived noise level, over the duration of an aircraft
    flyover; the reference duration is 10 s

  notes:
  - The integral is usually approximated by one-half the summation, over the top ten
    decibels of an aircraft flyover, of the antilogarithms of one-tenth of the tone-corrected
    perceived noise level in successive 0,5 s intervals.
  - Effective perceived noise level purports to represent subjective noisiness.
  - Effective perceived noise level of an aircraft flyover tends to be 2 dB or 3 dB
    greater than A-weighted sound exposure level.
