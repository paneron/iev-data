  definition: for a fluid with laminar flow in `x`-direction, thus for which `v`~`y`~
    = `v`~`z`~ = 0 and `v`~`x`~ = `v`~`x`~ (`z`) ≥ 0, where `x`, `y`, `z` are Cartesian
    coordinates, scalar quantity characterizing internal friction and equal to `((tau_((x
    z))))/((d v_x // d z))`, where `τ`~`xz`~ is the shear stress in the fluid
