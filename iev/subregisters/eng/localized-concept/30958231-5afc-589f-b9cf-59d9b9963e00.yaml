  definition: for a real or complex function `f`(`t`) of the real variable `t`, complex
    function `F ( omega )` of the real variable `ω`, given by the integral transformation
    `F ( omega ) = int_( - oo)^( + oo) f ( t ) e^(- j omega t) d t` where j is the
    imaginary unit

  notes:
  - If `t` is time, the variable `ω` represents angular frequency.
  - The Fourier transform of the function `f` is also denoted F`f` or ℱ`f`.
