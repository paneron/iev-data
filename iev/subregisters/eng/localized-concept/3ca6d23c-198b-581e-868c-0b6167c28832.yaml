  definition: density of exiting photon flux with respect to area at a point on a
    real or imaginary surface `M_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d A))` where `Φ`~p~ is photon flux
    and `A` is the area from which the photon flux leaves

  notes:
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exitance". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "luminous exitance".
  - The photon exitance is expressed in second to the power minus one per square metre
    (s^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-49 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
