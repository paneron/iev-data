  definition: limit, if it exists, of the quotient of the conditional probability
    that the failure of a non-repairable item occurs within time interval (`t`, `t`
    + Δ`t`) by Δ`t`, when Δ`t` tends to zero, given that failure has not occurred
    within time interval (0, `t`) `lambda ( t ) = underset((Delta t -> 0))((lim))
    (1)/((Delta t)) ((F ( t + Delta t ) – F ( t )))/((R ( t ))) = ((f ( t )))/((R
    ( t )))` where `F`(`t`) and `f`(`t`) are, respectively, the distribution function
    and the probability density at the failure instant, and where `R`(`t`) is the
    reliability function, related to the reliability `R`(`t`~1~, `t`~2~) by `R`(`t`)
    = `R`(0, `t`).
