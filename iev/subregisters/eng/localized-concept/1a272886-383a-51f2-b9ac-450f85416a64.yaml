  definition: density of exiting radiant flux with respect to area at a point on a
    real or imaginary surface `M_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d A))` where `Φ`~e~ is radiant
    flux and `A` is the area from which the radiant flux leaves

  notes:
  - For Planckian radiation, `M`~e~ = `σT`^4^ where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
    and `T` is thermodynamic temperature.
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous exitance". The corresponding
    photon quantity is "photon exitance".
  - The radiant exitance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-47 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
