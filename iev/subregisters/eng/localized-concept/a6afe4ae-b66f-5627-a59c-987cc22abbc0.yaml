  notes:
  - The notation `A sub B` expresses that the set `A` is a proper subset of the set
    `B`. The symbol `underset(!=)( sub )` is sometimes used instead of `sub` but is
    not recommended, and it should be used when the latter is used for any subset
    of `B`. `A` is also said to be properly included in `B`.
