  definition: density of luminous flux with respect to solid angle in a specified
    direction `I_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d omega))` where `Φ`~v~ is the luminous flux emitted
    in a specified direction, and `Ω` is the solid angle containing that direction

  notes:
  - For practical realization of the quantity, the source is approximated by a <a
    href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>.
  - 'The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (`ϑ`, `φ`), is used to determine the
    luminous flux, `Φ`~v~, within a certain solid angle, `Ω`, of a source:


    `Phi_v = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_v ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi \ d
    vartheta`.'
  - 'Luminous intensity can be derived from the spectral radiant intensity distribution
    by


    `I_v = \ K_m int_0^(oo) I_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, `I`~e,`λ`~(`λ`) is the spectral radiant
    intensity at wavelength `λ`, and `V`(`λ`) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral
    luminous efficiency</a>.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant intensity". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon intensity".
  - The luminous intensity is expressed in candela (cd = lm·sr^−1^).
