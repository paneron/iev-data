  definition: vector *rot* `*U*` associated at each point of a given space region
    with a vector *`U`*, equal to the limit of the integral over a closed surface
    S of the vector product of the vector surface element and the vector *`U`*, divided
    by the volume of the interior of the surface, when the surface is contained in
    a sphere the radius of which tends to zero `rot U = underset((V -> 0))((lim))
    (1)/(V) underset(S)( âˆ¯ ) e_n xx U d A` where *`e`*~n~d`A` is the vector surface
    element oriented outwards and `V` is the volume

  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the three coordinates of the rotation are:


    `((del U_z))/((del y)) - ((del U_y))/((del z)) , ((del U_x))/((del z)) - ((del
    U_z))/((del x)) , ((del U_y))/((del x)) - ((del U_x))/((del y))`'
  - The rotation of a polar vector is an axial vector and the rotation of an axial
    vector is a polar vector.
  - The rotation of the vector field *`U`* is denoted by `rot U` or `grad xx U`. In
    some English texts, the rotation is denoted by `curl U`.
