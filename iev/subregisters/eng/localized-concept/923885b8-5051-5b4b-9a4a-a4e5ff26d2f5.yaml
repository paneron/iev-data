  definition: for a system of elementary entities distributed in space, qualifies
    the length, the area, or the volume of an element of space, all the geometrical
    dimensions of which are small compared with those of the system under consideration
    but sufficiently large for the element of space to contain a large number of elementary
    entities; qualifies also an extensive quantity when summed for all elementary
    entities within such an element of space

  notes:
  - The elementary entities can be, for example, elementary particles, molecules,
    ions, charge carriers, or macroscopic entities such as solid particles or droplets.
  - An extensive quantity (IEV 112-01-06), such as mass, electric charge, or resistance,
    is additive for disjointed parts of a system. An intensive quantity (IEV 112-01-05),
    such as mass density, electric charge density, or resistivity, is determinable
    at any point of a system.
  - The concept can be used to define intensive quantities by the quotient of two
    quasi-infinitesimal quantities related to the same element of space. Examples
    are volumic electric charge (IEV 121-11-07) and electric current density (IEV
    121-11-11).
  - The term "quasi-infinitesimal" is used to distinguish this concept from that of
    infinitesimal in the mathematical sense.
