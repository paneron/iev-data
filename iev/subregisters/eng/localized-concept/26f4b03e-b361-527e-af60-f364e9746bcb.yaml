    highest value of the secondary voltage setting, the electrodes being short-circuited
    according to specified test conditions and the machine being arranged so as to
    have successively: a) minimum impedance corresponding to the minimum throat depth
    and gap; b) maximum impedance corresponding to the maximum throat depth and gap.'
