  definition: 'for an inductive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, derivative
    of the linked flux `Î¨` between the terminals with respect to the electric current
    `i` in the element: `L_d = ((d Psi))/((d i))` where the sign of the linked flux
    is determined by taking the voltage, in the time integral defining it, as the
    difference of the electric potentials at A and B, and where the current is taken
    as positive if its direction is from A to B and negative in the opposite case'

  notes:
  - For an ideal inductor, the differential inductance `L`~d~ is equal to its inductance
    `L`.
