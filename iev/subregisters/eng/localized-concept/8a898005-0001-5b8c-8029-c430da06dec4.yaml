  notes:
  - For non-directional light sources, the useful luminous flux is the total luminous
    flux of the light source.
  - For directional light sources the useful luminous flux is the partial luminous
    flux in a defined cone angle, the axis of the cone being the optical beam axis
    of the light source.
  - The cone angle, `α`, which can be expressed either in degree (°) or radian (rad),
    is given by the full conic angle and has to be specified, e.g. `Φ`~u,90°~ or `Φ`~u,π/2~.
  - The optical beam axis of a light source is the axis about which the luminous intensity
    is substantially symmetrical.
  - The useful luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
