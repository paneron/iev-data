  definition: reactive L-network derived from a prototype L-section filter in such
    a way that the pass-band(s) and stop-band(s) are the same and that one and only
    one image impedance is left unchanged with the same direction

  notes:
  - Either the impedance of the series branch is multiplied by `m`, or the impedance
    of the shunt branch is divided by `m`.
