  notes:
  - In order to determine the position of a body in space at any instant it is necessary
    to know, in addition to its orbital elements, the position of its centre of mass
    in its orbit at one given instant.
  - The frame of reference used is usually a direct rectangular co-ordinate system
    OXYZ, in which the origin is at the centre of mass of the primary body and the
    third axis OZ is perpendicular to the principal reference plane.
  - For an artificial earth satellite, the principal reference plane is the Earth's
    equatorial plane and the third axis OZ has a south-to-north orientation.
