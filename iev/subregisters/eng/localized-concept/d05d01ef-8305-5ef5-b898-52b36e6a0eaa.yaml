    tension `V`~m~ `Lambda = (Phi)/((V_m))`

  notes:
  - The permeance is the reciprocal of the reluctance.
  - The coherent SI unit of permeance is henry, H.
  - In an electric equivalent circuit, the permeances are represented by conductances,
    magnetic fluxes by electric currents and magnetic tensions by voltages.
