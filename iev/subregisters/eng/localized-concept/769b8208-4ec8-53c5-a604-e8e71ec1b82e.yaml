  notes:
  - Compared with a rigid endoscope consisting of lenses alone, a fibre endoscope
    is flexible and can be easily bent because thin fibres are bundled, and therefore
    it is used to see the inside of tubular organs such as digestive tracts and blood
    vessels. Fibre endoscopes are also used for industrial purposes such as inspection
    of the inside of pipes and jet engines. With microsurgical tools loaded on the
    inside of endoscopes, a doctor can perform a surgical operation while observing
    the diseased part. Research and development for making microsurgical tools is
    also in progress.
