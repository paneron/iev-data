    of a receiving antenna to the power flux density of a plane wave of specified
    polarization incident on the antenna from that direction

  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction corresponding to maximum available
    power is implied.
  - 'In free space, for a given polarization and direction, the partial effective
    area `A`~ep~ of an antenna used for reception is related to the partial gain `G`~p~
    of the same antenna used for transmission, by the equation:


    `G_p = ((4 pi A_((ep))))/((lambda^2))`


    where `Î»` is the wavelength.'
