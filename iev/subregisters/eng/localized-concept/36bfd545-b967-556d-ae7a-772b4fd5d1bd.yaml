  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of the magnitude `F`~t~ of
    the friction force to the magnitude `F`~n~ of the normal force, thus `Î¼` = `F`~t~
    / `F`~n~

  notes:
  - The friction force is the tangential component and the normal force is the normal
    component of the contact force between two sliding bodies.
