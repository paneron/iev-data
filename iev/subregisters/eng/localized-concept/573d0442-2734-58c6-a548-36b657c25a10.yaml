  definition: integrated MEMS {{device, IEV:151-11-20}}, in which complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
    (CMOS) signal-processing circuits and MEMS elements are formed on the same silicon

  notes:
  - CMOS MEMS is one form of the MEMS device that integrates CMOS signal-processing
    circuits and MEMS elements. Usually, the CMOS MEMS is fabricated by performing
    a MEMS process on the CMOS preformed {{wafer, IEV:521-05-29}}, and therefore it
    is necessary that the MEMS process does not damage the CMOS circuit.
