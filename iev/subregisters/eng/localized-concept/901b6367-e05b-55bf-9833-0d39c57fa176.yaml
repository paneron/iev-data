    fixed in position, engaged and interleaved with a second, movable set of fingers

  notes:
  - The application of an electrostatic charge to the first set of fingers attracts
    the fingers of the second set, such that they become more fully engaged in the
    interdigit spaces of the first set. Then the static charge is removed and drained,
    and the second set of fingers is returned to its home position by micromachined
    spring tension.
