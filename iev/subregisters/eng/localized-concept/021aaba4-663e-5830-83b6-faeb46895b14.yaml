  definition: macroscopic quantum effect, occurring at low temperature in a two-dimensional
    system of high-mobility electrons or holes, in which an applied magnetic field
    induces between two points a voltage, the quotient of which by the electric current
    through a line joining the two points assumes, over certain high-value ranges
    of the magnetic flux density, quantized plateau values equal to `R`~K~/`n`, where
    `R`~K~ = `h`/`e`^2^ is the von Klitzing constant and `n` an integer, `h` being
    the Planck constant and `e` the elementary electric charge

  notes:
  - The quotient of the voltage by the electric current is called Hall resistance.
    The value of the von Klitzing constant is 25 812,807 557(18) Î© (CODATA, 2006).
