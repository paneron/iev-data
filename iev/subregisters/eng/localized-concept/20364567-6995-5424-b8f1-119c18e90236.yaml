  definition: magnitude of the angular velocity *`ω`* divided by the angle 2π, thus
    `n` = |*`ω`*|/2π

  notes:
  - 1 The rotational frequency is also the derivative of the absolute value of angle
    of rotation `φ` with respect to time `t`, divided by 2π, thus `n = (1)/((2 pi))
    ((d | phi |))/((d t))`.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of rotational frequency is second to the power minus one,
    s^–1^. The units revolution per second, symbol r/s, and revolution per minute,
    symbol r/min, are widely used in specifications for rotating machines.
