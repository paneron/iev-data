  definition: phenomenon in which the magnetic area moments of neighbouring atoms
    or ions in a substance are approximately aligned in the same direction over certain
    regions due to their interactions and in which the alignment of the resultant
    magnetic area moments of the regions increases up to a certain limit when an increasing
    magnetic field strength is applied
