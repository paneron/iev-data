  definition: law giving the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a> of
    radiance of a <a href="IEV845-24-004">Planckian radiator</a> as a function of
    wavelength and temperature `L_((e , lambda)) ( lambda , T ) = ((del L_e ( lambda
    , T )))/((del lambda)) = ((c_1))/(pi) lambda^(- 5) ( e^(((c_2))/((lambda T)))
    - 1 )^(- 1)` where `L`~e,~`λ` is the spectral radiance, `λ` is the wavelength
    in vacuum, `T` is the thermodynamic temperature, `c_1 \ = 2 \ pi \ h \ c_0^2`,
    `c_2 \ = h \ c_0 \ // \ k`, `h` is the Planck constant, `c`~0~ is the {{speed
    of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}, and `k` is the Boltzmann constant

  notes:
  - The formula is sometimes written with `((c_1))/((pi omega_0))` instead of `((c_1))/(pi)`,
    where `Ω`~0~ is the solid angle of magnitude 1 sr.
  - For a detector in a medium of refractive index `n`, the measured radiance is `n`^2^`L`~e,~`λ`(`λ`,
    `T`).
  - Planck's law can also be expressed to give the spectral distribution of radiant
    exitance, `M`~e,~`λ`(`λ`, `T`); the first factor in the formula is then `c`~1~
    instead of `((c_1))/(pi)`.
  - Both quantities (radiance and radiant exitance) apply to the <a href="IEV845-21-021">unpolarized
    radiation</a> as emitted.
  - For the up-to-date values of the Planck constant, `h`, the {{speed of light in
    vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}, `c`~0~, and the Boltzmann constant, `k`, see CODATA.
