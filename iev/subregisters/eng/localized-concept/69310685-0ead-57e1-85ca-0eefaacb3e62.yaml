  definition: quotient of the spectral responsivity, `s`(`位`), of the detector at
    wavelength, `位`, and a specified reference value, `s`~m~ `s_r ( lambda ) = ((s
    ( lambda )))/((s_m))`

  notes:
  - The specified reference value, `s`~m~, can be an average value, a maximum value
    or an arbitrarily chosen value of `s`(`位`).
  - The relative spectral responsivity has unit one.
