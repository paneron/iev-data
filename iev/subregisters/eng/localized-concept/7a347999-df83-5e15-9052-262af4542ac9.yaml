  definition: axial vector quantity describing the rotation around an axis, with magnitude
    `omega = | d phi // d t |`, where `d phi` is the plane angle change during the
    infinitesimal time interval with duration d`t`, and with direction along the axis
    for which the rotation is clockwise

  notes:
  - 1 In an inertial frame, the angular velocity does not depend on the chosen coordinate
    system provided that the orientation of space is kept (either right-handed or
    left-handed).
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of angular velocity is radian per second, rad/s.
