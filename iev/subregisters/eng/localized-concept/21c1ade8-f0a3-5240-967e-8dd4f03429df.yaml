  notes:
  - 1 The kinetic energy of a body is given by the integral `T = (1)/(2) int_D v^2
    d m,` where D is a domain containing the body. When the axis of rotation is through
    the centre of mass, `T` is also given by `T = (1)/(2) m_t v_G^2 + (1)/(2) J omega^2`,
    where `m`~t~ is total mass, `V`~G~ is speed of the centre of mass, `J` is moment
    of inertia relative to the axis of rotation, and `ω` is the magnitude of the angular
    velocity, and where `v`~G~, `J`, and `ω` can be time-dependent.
  - 2 In relativity, the dependence of the mass `m` on the speed `v` has to be considered.
