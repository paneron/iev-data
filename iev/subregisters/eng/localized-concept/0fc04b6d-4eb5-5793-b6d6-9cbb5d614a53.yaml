  definition: quotient of the average radiant flux density or luminous flux density,
    `Φ`~2~/`A`~2~ (or `Φ`~1~/`A`~1~), received over surface S~2~ (or S~1~) from surface
    S~1~ (or S~2~) and the radiant exitance or luminous exitance, `M`~1~ (or `M`~2~),
    of surface S~1~ (or S~2~) `f_((21)) = ((Phi_2))/((A_2 M_1)) = (g)/((A_2))` or
    `f_((12)) = ((Phi_1))/((A_1 M_2)) = (g)/((A_1))` with `A_2 f_((21)) = g = A_1
    f_((12))` where `Φ`~2~ (or `Φ`~1~) is the radiant flux or luminous flux received
    over surface S~2~ (or S~1~) from surface S~1~ (or S~2~), `A`~2~ (or `A`~1~) is
    the area of surface S~2~ (or S~1~) and `g` is the mutual exchange coefficient
