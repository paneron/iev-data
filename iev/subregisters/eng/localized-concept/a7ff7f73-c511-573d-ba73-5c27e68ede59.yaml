  notes:
  - This term is used in the "uncertainty" approach.
  - The "conventional true value" is sometimes called "assigned value", "best estimate
    of the value", "conventional value" or "reference value". The term "reference
    value", in this sense, should not be confused with "reference value" in the sense
    used in 311-07-01.
  - Frequently, a large number of results of measurement of a quantity are used to
    establish a conventional true value.
  - Traditional definitions, based on the true value approach, treated the conventional
    true value as a value approximating to a true value of the quantity such that
    the difference could be neglected for the purposes for which that value was used.
