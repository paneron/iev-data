  definition: 'the quotient of d`E`~col~ by the product of `ρ` and d`l`, where d`E`~col~
    is the energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy by collisions in
    traversing the path length d`l` in a material of density `ρ` : `((S_((col))))/(rho)
    = (1)/(rho) * (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_((col))`'

  notes:
  - The energy losses included are those that produce excitation and ionization of
    atoms as well as those producing recoil atoms.
