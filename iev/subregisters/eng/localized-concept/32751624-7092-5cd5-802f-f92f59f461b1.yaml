  definition: 'energy transmitted by ionizing radiation to the matter in a given volume
    such that: `ε` = `R`~1~ – `R`~2~ + ∑`Q` where * `R`~1~ is the radiant energy incident
    on the volume, i.e. the sum of the energies, excluding rest energies, of all those
    directly and indirectly ionizing particles which enter the volume, * `R`~2~ is
    the radiant energy emerging from the volume, i.e. the sum of the energies, excluding
    rest energies, of all those directly and indirectly ionizing particles which leave
    the volume, and * ∑`Q` is the sum of all changes of the rest mass energy of atomic
    nuclei and elementary particles in any nuclear transformations which occur in
    the volume; a positive sign is used when the change is a decrease and a negative
    sign when the change is an increase'

  notes:
  - The energy imparted is a stochastic quantity, identical to the integral absorbed
    dose in that volume, and expressed in joules (J).
