  notes:
  - The self-exchange coefficient of a surface, S, limited by a flat curve, C, and
    situated on only one side of the plane of this curve is equal to the surface area
    of S minus the flat surface area limited by C.
  - The self-exchange coefficient is expressed in square metre (m^2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-09-74 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
