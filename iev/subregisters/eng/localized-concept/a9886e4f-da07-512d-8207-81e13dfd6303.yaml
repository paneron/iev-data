  definition: quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-049">radiance</a> at a surface element
    of a medium in a given direction and the <a href="IEV845-21-053">irradiance</a>
    on the medium `q_e = ((L_e))/((E_e))` where `L`~e~ is radiance and `E`~e~ is irradiance

  notes:
  - The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is similar to the
    radiance coefficient except that it is defined for directional incident radiation.
  - The radiance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus one (sr^âˆ’1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-70 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
