  definition: the relative permeability obtained from the peak value of the magnetic
    flux density and the peak value of the applied magnetic field strength, at a stated
    amplitude of either, when the field strength is varying periodically with time
    and with an average of zero, and the material is initially in a specified neutralized
    state

  notes:
  - 'Two amplitude permeabilities are in common use, namely:


    i) that in which the peak values apply to the actual waveforms,


    ii) that in which the peak values apply to the fundamental components, in which
    case it should be distinguished which of the waveforms, if either, is sinusoidal.'
  - '`hat B` and `hat H` can be static values provided the material is in a cyclic
    magnetic condition.'
