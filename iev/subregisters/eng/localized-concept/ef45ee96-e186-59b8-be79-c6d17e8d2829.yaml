  definition: 'the fractional decrease of permeability of a magnetic material measured
    at constant temperature at the beginning and at the end of a given time interval:
    `D = ((mu_1 - mu_2))/((mu_1))` where `µ`~1~ and `µ`~2~ are the values of the permeabilities
    at the beginning and at the end of the given interval respectively'
