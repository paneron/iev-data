  definition: scalar quantity equal to the tangential component d`F`~t~ of a force
    acting on a surface element divided by the area d`A` of the element, thus `Ï„`
    = d`F`~t~ / d`A`

  notes:
  - 1 In anisotropic media, shear stress may depend on the orientation of the surface
    and may be described by tensor.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of shear stress is pascal, Pa.
