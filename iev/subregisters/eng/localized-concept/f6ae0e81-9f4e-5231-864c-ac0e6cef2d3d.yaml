  notes:
  - The load cycle is expressed in per unit of the rated currents.
  - The load cycle shows the repetitive variation of the loads with time and, hence,
    the overloads and underloads the converter group is expected to carry, as well
    as, for the transformers, the duration and intervals assumed.
