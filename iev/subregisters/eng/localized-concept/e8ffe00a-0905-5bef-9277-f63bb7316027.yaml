  notes:
  - For indicating the shape of the scattering indicatrix it is recommended that the
    diffusion factor, `σ`, be used for strongly diffusing materials, and the half-value
    angle, `γ`, for poorly diffusing materials.
  - The half-value angle is expressed in radian (rad) or degree (°).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-90 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
