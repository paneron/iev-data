  definition: 'a unidirectional pulse defined as a function of time `t` by the expressions:
    `y` = k sin^2^ (`π t`/2`T`) for 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 2`T` `y` = 0 for `t` <0 and `t` > 2`T`
    where: `y` is the instantaneous value of the characteristic quantity, k is the
    peak value of the pulse, 2`T` is the duration of the pulse, `T` being the length
    of time during which the characteristic quantity is greater than k/2'
