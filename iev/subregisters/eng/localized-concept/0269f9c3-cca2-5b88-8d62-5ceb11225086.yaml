  definition: at each point of a given space region, scalar `φ` the negative of the
    gradient of which is the vector *`U`* of a given field *`U`* = −*grad* `φ`

  notes:
  - The vector field *`U`* is a {{conservative field, IEV:102-05-34}} and is said
    to be derived from the scalar field `φ`.
  - The scalar potential is not unique since any constant scalar can be added to a
    given scalar potential without changing its gradient.
  - Examples of potential are the {{electric potential, IEV:121-11-25}} and the potential
    in mechanics (see {{IEV 113-03-19, IEV:113-03-19}}).
  - The term "scalar potential" is only used in place of the term "potential" to distinguish
    it from the term "vector potential".
