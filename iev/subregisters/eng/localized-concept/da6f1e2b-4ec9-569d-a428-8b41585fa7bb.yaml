  definition: 'temperature of the Planckian radiator whose <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative
    spectral distribution</a>, `S`(`λ`) is the same or nearly the same as that of
    the radiation considered in the spectral range of interest for which the following
    integral is minimized by adjustment of `a` and `T`: `int_((lambda_1))^((lambda_2))
    1 - ((S_t ( lambda )))/((a S_b ( lambda , T )))^2 d lambda` where `λ` is the wavelength,
    `S`~t~(`λ`) is the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a>
    of the radiation being considered, `S`~b~(`λ`, `T`) is the relative spectral distribution
    of the Planckian radiator at temperature `T`, and `a` is a scaling factor'

  notes:
  - 'The scaling factor `a` is chosen to make the quotient `((S_t ( lambda )))/((S_b
    ( lambda , T )))` equal to unity at a convenient wavelength which, in photometry
    and colorimetry is typically 560 nm.


    `S_b ( lambda , T ) = ((P ( lambda , T )))/((P ( 560 nm , T )))`


    with `P ( lambda , T ) = lambda^(- 5) ( e^(((c_2))/((lambda T))) - 1 )^(- 1)`,
    where `c`~2~ is the second radiation constant.'
  - Distribution temperature is a meaningful characteristic for radiators having a
    <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> similar to that of
    a Planckian radiator, but only if calculated for an expanded wavelength range
    and for radiation whose <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a> of radiant
    flux is a continuous function of wavelength in that range.
  - In photometry and colorimetry the wavelength range set by `λ`~1~ and `λ`~2~ is
    the visible spectral range, and in these cases the range from at least `λ`~1~
    = 400 nm to `λ`~2~ = 750 nm is recommended.
  - In practice, the integral is replaced by a summation. For <a href="IEV845-27-011">incandescent
    lamps</a>, equally spaced wavelength intervals of 10 nm will usually suffice.
    All values in the summation are treated with equal weight.
  - The distribution temperature is expressed in kelvin (K).
