  definition: '{{energizing quantity, IEV:447-03-01}} that by itself constitutes the
    {{characteristic quantity, IEV:447-07-01}}, or helps to constitute it'
  examples:
  - '* Current, for {{current relay, IEV:447-01-27}}, {{thermal electric relay, IEV:447-01-36}}
    and ({{differential relay, IEV:447-01-40}});* voltage, for {{voltage relay, IEV:447-01-28}},
    {{frequency relay, IEV:447-01-29}}, {{volt per hertz relay, IEV:447-01-47}} and
    {{synchronizing relay, IEV:447-01-45}};* voltage and current, for {{impedance
    relay, IEV:447-01-30}}, {{directional relay, IEV:447-01-41}} and {{power relay,
    IEV:447-01-42}}.


    Note 1 to entry: The {{input energizing quantity, IEV:447-03-02}} can be applied
    to a {{measuring relay, IEV:447-01-02}} or {{protection equipment, IEV:447-01-49}}
    either by hardwire from {{instrument transformers, IEV:321-01-01}} or as a data
    packet over communication ports using an appropriate data communication protocol,
    such as IEC 61850-9-2.


    Note 2 to entry: In IEC 60050-447:2010, "characteristic energizing quantity" was
    numbered 447-03-03, as a substitute of {{"input energising quantity", IEV:447-03-02}},
    and "input energising quantity" was provisionally defined for the existing IEC 60255
    series standards. However, "input energizing quantity" is internationally accepted.'
