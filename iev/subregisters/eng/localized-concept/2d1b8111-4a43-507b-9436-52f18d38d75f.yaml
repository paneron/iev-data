  definition: 'a method of justification in which the digit time-slots used to convey
    a digital signal have a digit rate that is always higher than the digit rate of
    the original signal, and in which at each justification instant, depending on
    the prevailing conditions, either: a) no digit of the original signal is transmitted
    but, instead, a justifying digit is transmitted in the justifiable digit time-slot,
    or b) one digit of the original signal is transmitted in the justifiable digit
    time-slot, with these two alternative justification states being indicated by
    unique signals formed from justification service digits'
