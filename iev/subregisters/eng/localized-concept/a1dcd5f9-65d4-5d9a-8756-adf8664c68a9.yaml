  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of that part of the radiation
    intensity in a given direction, corresponding to a given polarization, to the
    radiation intensity that would be obtained if the power accepted by the antenna
    were radiated equally in all directions

  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - The absolute gain of an antenna is the sum of the partial gains, expressed as
    power ratios, for any two orthogonal polarizations.
