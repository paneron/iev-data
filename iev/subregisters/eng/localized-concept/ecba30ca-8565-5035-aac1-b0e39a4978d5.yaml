  definition: quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a>, `X位`(`位`),
    of a radiant, luminous or photon quantity, `X`(`位`), and a fixed reference value,
    `R`, which can be an average value, a maximum value or an arbitrarily chosen value
    of this distribution `S ( lambda ) = ((X_(lambda) ( lambda )))/(R)`
