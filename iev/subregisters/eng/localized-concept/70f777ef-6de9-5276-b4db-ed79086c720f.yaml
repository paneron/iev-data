  notes:
  - 1 Equilibrium state is achieved by an isolated system after sufficiently long
    time, depending on the considered process.
  - 2 The equilibrium state is the macrostate having the highest number of different
    microstates among all macrostates of an isolated system.
  - 3 Fluctuations exist even in the equilibrium state, but they are not considered
    in this concept.
