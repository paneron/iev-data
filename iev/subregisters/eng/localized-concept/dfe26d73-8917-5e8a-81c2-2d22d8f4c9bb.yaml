  definition: spectral internal absorptance of a layer of an absorbing material such
    that the path of the radiation is of dimension length, and under conditions in
    which the boundary of the material has no influence

  notes:
  - The unit of the quantity length has to be specified. If a new unit of length is
    used that is `k` times the magnitude of the original one, then the value of `alpha_(i
    ,o)^() ( lambda ) = 1 - tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )` will change to `alpha^( ' )_(i
    ,o)^() ( lambda ) = 1 - tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )^k`.
  - The spectral absorptivity has unit one.
