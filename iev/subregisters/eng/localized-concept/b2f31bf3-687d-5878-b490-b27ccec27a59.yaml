  definition: 'switching system the values of the output variables of which at a specified
    instant depend on the values of the input variables and the values of the state
    variables at this instant, whereas the values of the state variables of the system
    at a following instant depend on the values of the state variables and the values
    of the input variables at the specified instant SEE: Figure 22.'

  - For the sequential circuit a specific stability does exist. This stability means
    the property that the input variable which has caused the transition to a specific
    state cannot interact with this state or cannot cause another transition when
    interacting with this state.
