  notes:
  - Where a phase displacement can be associated with eddy currents, hysteresis or
    residual losses, the loss angle may be designated by `δ`~F~ for eddy current loss,
    `δ`~h~ for hysteresis loss and `δ`~r~ for residual loss.
  - 'The tangent of loss angle is often used to express the losses in a magnetic material:


    `tan delta_m = (mu^( ″ ))/(mu^( '' ))`


    where `µ`′ and `µ`″ are the real and imaginary components respectively of the
    complex permeability (symb.: `µ`).'
