  notes:
  - 1 The quantities corresponding to thermodynamic temperature and Celsius temperature
    defined by this scale are denoted `T`~90~ and `t`~90~, respectively, where `t`~90~
    = `T`~90~ − `T`~0~ with `T`~0~:= 273,15 K.
  - 2 The units of `T`~90~ and `t`~90~ are the kelvin, symbol K, and the degree Celsius,
    symbol °C, respectively.
