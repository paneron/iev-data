  definition: the velocity vector at a point, in a propagation medium, of a signal
    which may be ideally represented by two superimposed sinusoidal waves of equal
    amplitude and slightly different frequencies approaching a common limiting value

  notes:
  - 'In the most general case the reciprocal of the magnitude `| vec v_g |` of the
    group velocity vector is equal to the derivative of the reciprocal of the wavelength
    `Î»` with respect to the frequency `f`:


    `(1)/((| vec v_g |)) = ((d ( lambda^(- 1) )))/((d f))`'
