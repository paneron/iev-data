  definition: series of levels of {{digital multiplexing, IEV:704-20-01}} in which
    each level is characterized by a defined bit rate, and in which each level handles
    a {{digital signal, IEV:704-01-05}} assembled by multiplexing signals whose bit
    rate is that of a lower level

  notes:
  - The Standardization Sector of ITU has standardized two digital multiplex hierarchies,
    the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) and the synchronous digital hierarchy
    (SDH).
