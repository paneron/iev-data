  definition: '{{distance relay, IEV:447-01-32}}, whose characteristic, when plotted
    on a rectangular coordinate system with {{resistance, IEV:131-12-04}} as X axis
    and {{reactance, IEV:131-12-46}} as Y axis, is a circle, the circumference of
    which does not pass through the origin Note 1 to entry: Other than in the designation
    of relays, the term "mho" (reciprocal of the term "ohm") has been replaced by
    "siemens" (1 S = 1 / Î©) as an SI unit of electric conductance.'
