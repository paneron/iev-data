  definition: for a point rotating around a fixed axis, quotient of the length travelled
    by the point and the distance from the point to the axis, taken positive or negative
    according to whether the rotation is observed to be in the counterclockwise sense
    or the clockwise sense, respectively, for an observer looking in the direction
    opposite to the direction of the axis

  notes:
  - 1 Angle of rotation can take any real value, whereas the angle or plane angle
    defined in geometry (see IEC 60050-102:2007, 102-04-14) is non-negative and restricted
    to the closed interval [0, π].
  - '2  The coherent SI unit of angle is radian (symbol rad). Other units accepted
    for use with the SI are degree (symbol °), minute (symbol ′) and second (symbol
    ″): 1° = (π/180) rad, 1′ = (1/60)°, 1″ = (1/60)′. A non-SI unit is revolution
    (symbol r).'
