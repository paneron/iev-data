  definition: 'for a given set of {{scalars, IEV:102-02-18}}, set of elements for
    which the sum of any two elements *`U`* and *`V`* and the product of any element
    and a scalar `α` are elements of the set, with the following properties: * `U
    + V = V + U`, * `( U + V ) + W = U + ( V + W )`, where *`W`* is also an element
    of the set, * there exists a neutral element for addition, called zero vector
    and denoted by *0*, such that: `U + 0 = U`, * there exists an opposite `( - U
    )` such that `U + ( - U ) = 0`, * `( alpha + beta ) U = alpha U + beta U`, where
    `β` is also a scalar, * `alpha ( U + V ) = alpha U + alpha V`, * `alpha ( beta
    U ) = ( alpha beta ) U`, * `1 U = U`'

  notes:
  - In the usual three-dimensional space, the directed line segments with a specified
    origin form an example of a vector space over real numbers. Another example, corresponding
    to the extended concept of scalar (see {{IEV 102-02-18, IEV:102-02-18}}, Note
    1) is the set of `n-`bit words formed of the digits 0 and 1 with addition modulo
    two, where the set of scalars is the set of two elements 0 and 1 subject to Boolean
    algebra.
