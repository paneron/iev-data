  notes:
  - "For the quantities `Q`~1~, `Q`~2~, and `Q`~3~ related by the quantity equation\
    \ `Q`~1~ = `ζ` `Q`~2~ `Q`~3~, the unit equation is &amp;lsqb;`Q`~1~&amp;rsqb;\
    \ = &amp;lsqb;`Q`~2~&amp;rsqb; &amp;lsqb;`Q`~3~&amp;rsqb;, where &amp;lsqb;`Q`~1~&amp;rsqb;,\
    \ &amp;lsqb;`Q`~2~&amp;rsqb;, and &amp;lsqb;`Q`~3~&amp;rsqb; denote the units\
    \ of `Q`~1~, `Q`~2~, and `Q`~3~, respectively, provided that these units are in\
    \ a coherent system of units.\n\nExamples: \r\n\r\n* J := kg m^2^ s^−2^, where\
    \ J, kg, m, and s are the symbols for the joule, kilogram, metre, and second,\
    \ respectively (the symbol := denotes “is by definition equal to”); \r\n* 1 km/h\
    \ = (1/3,6) m/s."
