  notes:
  - Reflectance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case,
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, `α` + `ρ` + `τ` = 1 except when <a href="IEV845-21-017">polarized
    radiation</a> is observed, where `α` is absorptance and `τ` is transmittance.
  - 'Reflectance, `ρ`, is the sum of regular reflectance, `ρ`~r~, and diffuse reflectance,
    `ρ`~d~: `ρ` = `ρ`~r~ + `ρ`~d~.'
  - The reflectance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-58 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
