  definition: electrical circuit which has the same characteristics as a piezoelectric
    resonator in the immediate neighbourhood of resonance
  examples:
  - 'A one-port piezoelectric resonator (see Figure 2) consists of series elements
    `L`~1~, `C`~1~, `R`~1~ in parallel with `C`~0~, where `L`~1~, `C`~1~, `R`~1~ represent
    the motional inductance, capacitance and resistance respectively and `C`~0~ the
    shunt capacitance. The circuit of Figure 2 has the same impedance as a piezoelectric
    resonator in the neighbourhood of resonance.
