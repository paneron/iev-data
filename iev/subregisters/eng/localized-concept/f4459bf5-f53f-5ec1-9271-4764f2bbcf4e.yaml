  definition: 'one-dimensionally distributed two-terminal-pair circuit element characterized
    by lineic inductance `l`, lineic capacitance `c`, lineic resistance `r` and lineic
    conductance `g` which may all be functions of the same space coordinate `x`, where
    the voltage `u`(`x, t`) and the electric current `i`(`x, t`), where `t` is the
    time, are related by the partial differential equations: `- ((del u ( x , t )))/((del
    x)) = r i + l ((del i ( x , t )))/((del t))` `- ((del i ( x , t )))/((del x))
    = g u + c ((del u ( x , t )))/((del t))`'
