  definition: for a signal including a sinusoidal oscillation of small amplitude superimposed
    on a DC component, a type of non-linearity distortion characterized by an undesired
    variation of the phase difference between the fundamental component of the output
    oscillation and the corresponding sinusoidal input oscillation as a function of
    the value of the input DC component
