  definition: the magneto-ionic component which, at vertical incidence, is reflected
    at the height at which the electron density is such that the plasma frequency
    is equal to the wave frequency

  notes:
  - This component has right-handed or left-handed elliptical polarization depending
    on whether the direction of propagation is at an obtuse or acute angle to the
    Earth's magnetic field vector.
  - When the direction of propagation is perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field,
    this component has linear polarization with the electric flux density vector in
    the plane defined by the direction of propagation and the magnetic field.
