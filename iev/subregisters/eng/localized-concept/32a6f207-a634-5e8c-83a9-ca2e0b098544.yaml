  definition: 'for a given vector space, set of elements called points, for which
    an element `U_((AB))` of the vector space is associated to any ordered pair of
    points A and B with the following properties: * for any two points A and B, `U_((BA))
    = - U_((AB))`, * for any three points A, B and C, `U_((AB)) + U_((BC)) = U_((AC))`,
    * for a given point O and a given vector *`r`*, there is a unique point P such
    that `U_((OP)) = r`'

  notes:
  - A point space and the associated vector space have the same dimension. The point
    space derived from the three-dimensional Euclidean vector space is a model of
    the usual geometrical three-dimensional space.
