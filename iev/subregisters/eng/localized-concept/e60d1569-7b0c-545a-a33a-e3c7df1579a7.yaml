  definition: quantity developed for the public domain, for weather forecasting and
    climatology, which quantifies the erythemal potential (or sunburning power) of
    the ambient solar <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet radiation</a>, but could
    also be applied to other sources

  notes:
  - 'The International Global UV Index, `I`~UV~, is defined by the formula:


    `I_((uv)) = k_((er)) int_((250 nm))^((400 nm)) E_(lambda) ( lambda ) s_((er))
    ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `Eλ`(`λ`) is the solar spectral irradiance expressed in W·m^−2^·nm^−1^ at
    wavelength `λ`, `s`~er~(`λ`) is the erythema spectral weighting function, and
    `k`~er~ is a constant equal to 40 m^2^·W^−1^.'
  - The global UV index has unit one.
