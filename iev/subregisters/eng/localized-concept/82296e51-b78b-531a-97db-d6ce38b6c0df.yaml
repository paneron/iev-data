  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:705-01-13}} of an {{electromagnetic wave, IEV:121-11-63}}
    such that the extremity of the {{electric flux density, IEV:121-11-40}} vector
    relative to a given point describes an ellipse whose centre coincides with this
    point'

  notes:
  - In a linear medium with properties independent of time, generally all {{sinusoidal
    waves, IEV:103-10-03}} are elliptically polarized, with {{linear polarization,
    IEV:705-01-14}} and {{circular polarization, IEV:705-01-20}} being special cases.
