  definition: occurrence of an accidental conductive path between a live conductor
    and the earth
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The conductive path can pass through a faulty insulation, through structures (e.g.
    poles, scaffoldings, cranes, ladders), or through vegetation (e.g. trees, bushes)
    and can have a significant impedance.
  - Earth faults with negligible fault impedance in a solidly earthed neutral system
    or in a low-impedance earthed neutral system are also named line-to-earth short-circuits.
