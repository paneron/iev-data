  definition: 'algebraic equation giving the number d`N` of particles of a non-quantized
    system, the components of velocity of which are comprised in the intervals (`u`,
    `u` + d`u`), (`v`, `v` + d`v`), (`w`, `w` + d`w`) respectively: `d N = A * exp
    ((- m ( u^2 + v^2 + w^2 )))/((2 k T)) d u * d v * d w` where `A = N (m)/((( 2
    pi * k T )))^(3 // 2)` `N` is the total number of particles `m` is the mass of
    a particle `T` is the thermodynamic temperature `k` is the Boltzmann constant'

  notes:
  - d`N`/`N` represents the probability that a particle has its components of velocity
    within the intervals considered.
