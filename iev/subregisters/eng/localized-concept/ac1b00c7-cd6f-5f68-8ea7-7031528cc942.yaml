  definition: time integral of erythemal irradiance `H_((er)) = int int E_(lambda)
    ( lambda , t ) s_((er)) ( lambda ) d lambda d t` where `Eλ`(`λ`, `t`) is spectral
    irradiance and `s`~er~(`λ`) is the erythema spectral weighting function normalized
    to 1 at its maximum

  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-26-068">minimal erythema dose</a>", "<a href="IEV845-26-069">standard
    erythema dose</a>".
  - The erythemal dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^).
