  definition: vector quantity with magnitude equal to the heat flow rate d`Φ` through
    a surface element divided by the area d`A` of the element, and direction *`e`*~`φ`~
    in the direction of propagation of heat, thus `phi = ((d Phi))/((d A)) e_(phi)`

  notes:
  - 1 At a fixed point in a medium, the direction of propagation of heat is opposite
    to the temperature gradient. At a point on the surface separating two media with
    different temperatures, the direction of propagation of heat is normal to the
    surface, from higher to lower temperatures.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of density of heat flux rate is watt per square metre,
    W/m^2^.
