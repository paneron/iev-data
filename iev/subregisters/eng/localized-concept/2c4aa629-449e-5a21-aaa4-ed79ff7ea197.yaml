  definition: 'a dimensionless complex scalar quantity `n`, characteristic of a medium
    at a given point and in a given direction, when there can exist in the medium
    a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave whose wave vector `vec underset(_)(K)` has colinear
    real and imaginary parts `vec K^( '' )` and `vec K^( ″ )`, in the given direction;
    this quantity is defined by the equation: `vec underset(_)(K) = vec K^( '' ) +
    j vec K^( ″ ) = underset(_)(n) (omega)/((c_0)) vec u` where `ω` is the angular
    frequency, `c`~0~ is the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum
    and `vec u` is the unit vector in the given direction'

  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium, the complex refractive index is the square root of the
    product of the relative complex permittivity and the relative complex permeability.
  - For each direction in an anisotropic medium, there are generally two distinct
    wave vectors and two values of the complex refractive index.
