  definition: for a passive linear two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with
    terminals A and B under sinusoidal conditions, quotient of the phasor `(underset(_)(U))_((AB))`
    representing the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals
    by the phasor `underset(_)(I)` representing the electric current in the element
    or circuit `underset(_)(Z) = (((underset(_)(U))_((A B))))/((underset(_)(I)))`
    where the sinusoidal voltage `u_((A B)) = v_A - v_B` represented by the phasor
    `(underset(_)(U))_((AB))` is the difference of the electric potentials `v_A` at
    A and `v_B` at B, and where the sinusoidal electric current represented by the
    phasor `underset(_)(I)` is taken positive if its direction is from A to B and
    negative if its direction is from B to A

  notes:
  - The impedance of an element or circuit is the inverse of its admittance. It is
    equal to `underset(_)(Z) = R + j X = Z e^(j phi)`, where `R` is resistance to
    alternating current, `X` is reactance, `Z` is apparent impedance, and `φ` is displacement
    angle.
  - 'With a suitable qualifier, the word impedance is used to form composite terms
    designating quantities of the same kind as impedance, e.g.: transfer impedance,
    characteristic impedance.'
  - The coherent SI unit of impedance is ohm, Ω.
