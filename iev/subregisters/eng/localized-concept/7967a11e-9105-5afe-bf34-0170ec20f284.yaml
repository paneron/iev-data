  definition: '{{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} of a set of events when they are equiprobable,
    i.e. `p`(`x`~`i`~) = 1/`n` for `i` = 1, …, `n`'
  examples: []
  id: 171-07-16
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - When the same integer base is used for the same number of events, the maximum
    entropy equals the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}}.
