  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The program versions are usually executed in separate processors.
  - Each version is capable of performing the given task. At least three versions
    are employed. A voter selects the result on which the majority of versions agree.
    If no majority exists, then the whole functional unit fails.
  - '`N`-version programming is an example of active redundancy, and is mostly used
    in avionics and process control systems.'
