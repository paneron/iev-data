  definition: at a given point within a three-dimensional domain of quasi-infinitesimal
    volume d`V`, scalar quantity equal to the mass d`m` within the domain divided
    by the volume d`V`, thus `œÅ` = d`m`/d`V`

  notes:
  - 1 Mass density is an intensive quantity describing a local property of a substance.
  - 2 The concept of mass density may also be applied to the mass `m` in a domain
    D with volume `V`, leading to the average density `rho_((av)) = (m)/(V) = (1)/(V)
    underset(D)( int ) rho d V`.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of mass density is kilogram per cubic metre, kg/m^3^. Other
    units are tonne per cubic metre, t/m^3^ (1 t/m^3^ = 1 000 kg/m^3^ = 1 g/cm^3^),
    and kilogram per litre, kg/l (1 kg/l = 1 000 kg/m^3^).
