  notes:
  - The CIE 1960 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram is substantially used for the
    determination of correlated colour temperature.
  - The <a href="IEV845-23-073">CIE 1976 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram</a> is
    a modified version of the CIE 1960 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram, which is
    equivalent to the (u, 3/2 v) diagram; therefore the (u, v) diagram is equivalent
    to the (u', 2/3 v') diagram.
