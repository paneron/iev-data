  definition: product of the Planck constant and {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} `Q`~p~
    = `h`·`ν` where `h` is the Planck constant and `ν` is the frequency of the corresponding
    electromagnetic wave

  notes:
  - Photon energy can be emitted, transferred or received.
  - The energy of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic radiation</a>, `Q`~PF~, by
    a photon flux of photons of frequency `ν` is equal to the photon number, `N`~p~,
    times the photon energy (`Q`~PF~ = `N`~p~·`h`·`ν`).
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant energy". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "<a href="IEV845-21-037">luminous energy</a>".
  - The photon energy is expressed in joule (J = W·s).
