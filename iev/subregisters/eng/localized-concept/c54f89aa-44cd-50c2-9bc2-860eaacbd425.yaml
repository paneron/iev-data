  notes:
  - The guiding surface may be the surface separating two media or an imaginary surface
    associated with a periodic structure. The reduction of the phase velocity may
    be obtained, for example, by means of a dielectric layer with high permittivity
    covering a conductor, or by transverse grooves in a conductor, or may be the result
    of the finite conductivity of a conductor.
