  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of viscosity
    and thermal diffusivity, defined by `P r = ((eta c_p))/(lambda) = (nu)/(alpha)`,
    where `η` is dynamic viscosity, `c`~`p`~ is specific heat capacity at constant
    pressure, `λ` is thermal conductivity, `ν` is kinematic viscosity, and `α` is
    thermal diffusivity
