  notes:
  - While the colour of a paint sample is sometimes considered to be a nominal property,
    it is also recognized that a pure colour can be characterized by the wavelength
    of electromagnetic radiation, which is a quantity that can be measured.
  - A nominal property has a value, which can be expressed in words, by alpha-numerical
    codes, or by other means. This value is not to be confused with the nominal value
    of a quantity (see {{IEV 151-16-09, IEV:151-16-09}}).
  - Nominal properties are distinguished from quantities, which are properties that
    have a magnitude, i.e. they can be compared in terms of greater or lesser.
