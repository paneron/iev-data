    photometric condition

  notes:
  - The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic).
    If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the symbol `K` is used.
    For other photometric conditions, the respective symbol for identification shall
    be used.
  - 'Luminous efficacy of radiation for photopic vision is expressed by


    `K = ((Phi_v))/(Phi_e)`


    where `Φ`~v~ is luminous flux and `Φ`~e~ is radiant flux.'
  - 'The value of the luminous efficacy of radiation for photopic vision for <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic
    radiation</a> of {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} `ν`~cd~ = 540 × 10^12^ Hz is defined
    as 683 lm·W^−1^ and denoted as `K`~cd~. The corresponding wavelength, `lambda_((cd))
    \ = n^(- 1) * c_((0)) * nu_(cd)^(- 1)` (where `n` is refractive index and `c`~0~
    is the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}) in standard air, i.e. dry
    air at 15 °C and 101 325 Pa, containing 0,045 % of carbon dioxide by volume (see
    P.E. Ciddor: _Refractive index of air: new equations for the visible and near
    infrared, Appl. Opt. Vol 35, No. 9_, 1996, pp. 1566-1573), is accepted to be 555,017 nm
    (rounded from 555,017 069 nm). This is very close to 555 nm, the wavelength where
    `V`(`λ`) reaches its maximum. For photometric measurements made in air under real
    environmental conditions, the influence of the variation of the refractive index
    on `λ`~cd~ with respect to standard air is typically in the range of a few picometres
    and can be neglected in most cases.'

  - The luminous efficacy of radiation is expressed in lumen per watt (lm·W^−1^).
