  notes:
  - In the case of progressive scanning, the points in a scanning line are aligned
    with those points in the temporally adjacent lines of the same field; in the case
    of interlaced scanning, the points in a scanning line are aligned with those points
    in the spatially adjacent lines of the preceding field.
