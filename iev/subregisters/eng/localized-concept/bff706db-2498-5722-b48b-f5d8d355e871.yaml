  definition: law relating the illuminance, `E`~v~, produced on a surface (which is
    normal to the direction of the light source and sufficiently distant for the light
    source to be considered as a <a href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>) by a light
    source to the luminous intensity, `I`~v~, of the light source in the direction
    of the surface, to the distance, `d`, between the surface and the light source,
    and to the atmospheric transmissivity, `T`, which is assumed to be uniform `E_v
    = ((I_v))/((d^2)) T^(d // d_0)` where `d`~0~ is the length specified in the definition
    of `T`

  notes:
  - 'The formula in the definition is sometimes written:


    `E_v = ((I_v))/((d^2)) T^(delta)`


    where the exponent, `δ`, in `Tδ` is the numerical value of the distance, `d`,
    measured with `d`~0~ as "unit".'
  - 'Taking into account the relationship between atmospheric transmissivity, `T`,
    and <a href="IEV845-31-018">meteorological optical range</a>, `v`, given in Note
    2 to entry of the definition of "meteorological optical range", Allard''s law
    can also be written as:


    `E_v = ((I_v))/((d^2)) ( 0,05^(d // v) )`.'
