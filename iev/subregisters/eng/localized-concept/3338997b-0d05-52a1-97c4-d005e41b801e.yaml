  definition: '. for a deterministic function, correlation function of the function
    and a time-delayed replica . for a stationary random function, mathematical expectation
    of the product of the function and a time-delayed replica: `C ( t ) = E f ( tau
    ) f ( t + tau )`'

  notes:
  - The autocorrelation function of a deterministic function or a stationary random
    function is the inverse Fourier transform of its power spectral density.
  - 'When a stationary random function can be considered as ergodic, its autocorrelation
    function can be calculated from a particular sample:


    `C ( t ) = underset((T -&gt; oo))((lim)) (1)/((2 T)) int_( - T)^( + T) f ( tau
    ) f ( t + tau ) d tau`'
