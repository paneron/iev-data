  notes:
  - For a linearly polarized wave, the polarization ellipse degenerates into a line
    segment and then the plane of polarization is not uniquely defined. In an {{isotropic,
    IEV:113-02-03}} medium, the plane of polarization is now conventionally taken
    to be normal to the {{direction of propagation, IEV:103-10-05}}. This is a change
    from previous practice when the plane of polarization was conventionally taken
    to be the plane containing the direction of propagation and a field vector, generally
    the {{electric field, IEV:121-11-67}} vector in {{radio waves, IEV:701-02-12}}
    or the {{magnetic flux density, IEV:121-11-19}} vector in optics.
