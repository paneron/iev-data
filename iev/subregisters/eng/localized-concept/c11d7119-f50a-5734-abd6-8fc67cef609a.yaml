  definition: phenomenon that a direct current transfers spatially from filament to
    filament in a composite superconductor, resulting in a voltage generation along
    the conductor
  examples: []

  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - In the `I`~c~ measurement, this phenomenon appears typically near the current
    contacts where the injected current flows along the conductor from periphery to
    inside until uniform.
