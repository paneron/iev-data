  notes:
  - 'When the electromechanical coupling factor is low, an approximate value of the
    frequency is given by the expression


    `f_p = (1)/((2 pi sqrt(L_1 ((C_1 C_0))/((C_1 + C_0)))))`


    where `C`~0~ represents the shunt capacitance and `L`~1~ and `C`~1~ the motional
    inductance and the motional capacitance respectively. The expression can be derived
    from Figure 2 by letting `R`~1~ = 0.
