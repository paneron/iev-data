  definition: 'Hermitian matrix *`A`* such that, for any non-zero column matrix *`U`*
    with complex elements, the 1 Ã— 1 matrix *`U`*^H^*`AU`* has a unique element which
    is real and positive: (*`U`*^H^*`AU`*)~11~ > 0'

  notes:
  - A symmetric matrix *`A`* with real elements is a positive definite matrix if *`U`*^T^*`AU`*
    &gt; 0 for any non-zero column matrix *`U`* with real elements.
  - All eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix are positive.
