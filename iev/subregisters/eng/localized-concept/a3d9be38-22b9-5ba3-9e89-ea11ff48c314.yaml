    and `N` the neutron number.
  - 2 The proton number gives the electric charge of the atomic nucleus in number
    of elementary electric charges.
  - 3 Atomic number is the order number of atom in the periodic chemical classification
    and relates to the chemical behaviour of the atom, i.e. its ability to produce
