  notes:
  - 'A tensor quantity often describes a linear transformation of a vector quantity
    *`U`* into a vector quantity *`V`*:


    `V_i = underset(j)( sum ) Q_((i j)) U_j`'
  - The expression of a tensor quantity in terms of its components is similar to the
    expression of vector quantities (see Note 1 to entry in {{IEV 102-03-22, IEV:102-03-22}}).
    Examples of tensor quantities are the permittivity and the permeability in anisotropic
    media, see IEC 60050-121.
  - Operations defined for tensors apply to tensor quantities.
