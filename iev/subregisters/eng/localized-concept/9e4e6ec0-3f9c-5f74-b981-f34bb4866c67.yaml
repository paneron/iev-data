  definition: limit, if it exists, of the quotient of the conditional probability
    that the repair is completed within time interval (`t`, `t` + Δ`t`) and Δ`t`,
    when Δ`t` tends to zero, given that the repair started at `t` = 0 and had not
    been completed before time `t`

    and its constituent parts.
