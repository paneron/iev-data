  definition: general principle that, in the absence of losses, the elementary radiant
    flux or luminous flux, d`Φ`, between two elementary areas d`A` and d`A`′ defining
    an elementary beam is proportional to the elementary projected areas d`A` cos
    `θ` and d`A`′ cos `θ` ′ in the direction of the beam and inversely proportional
    to the squared distance, `l`, between the areas

  notes:
  - 'The basic law of radiometry and photometry is expressed by


    `d Phi = L * ((d A cos theta * d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' )))/((l^2))`


    where the proportionality factor for this geometrical condition is equal to the
    radiance or luminance, respectively, within the elementary beam.'
  - The basic law of radiometry and photometry is based on the geometric extent.
