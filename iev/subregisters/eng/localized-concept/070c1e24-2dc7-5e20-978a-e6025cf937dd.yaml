  definition: vector quantity equal to the product of the mass `m` of a body and the
    velocity *`v`* of its centre of mass, thus *`p`* = `mv`

  notes:
  - 1 For a continuous body in a domain D, momentum is equal to the integral `p =
    int_D rho v d V = int_D v d m`, where `ρ` is the mass density in a domain having
    quasi-infinitesimal volume d`V` and mass d`m`, and velocity *`v`*. For a system
    of bodies, it is equal to the sum of their momentums.
  - 2 If the sum of external forces is equal to zero, momentum of a body follows a
    law of conservation.
  - 3 If the theory of relativity is applied, `m` is relativistic mass.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second, kg·m·s^−1^.
