  notes:
  - 'A protocol may define the conditions for establishing a connection to a transmission
    medium, the rules governing access to the medium, the procedures for error protection,
    the functional and procedural means of data exchange, the transport mechanisms,
    the communication control, the representation of data and the exchange of application
    data.


    Protocols define, for example:* data units transferred between participants,*
    the meaning of data units (semantics),* the format of data units (syntax) and*
    the logic time sequence of data exchange.'
  - The protocols used in a system may be organized in accordance with the OSI/ISO
    seven-layer reference model, for example.
