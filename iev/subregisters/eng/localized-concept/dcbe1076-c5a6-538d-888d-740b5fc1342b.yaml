  notes:
  - 'Photon flux, `Φ`~p~, is related to radiant flux, `Φ`~e~, of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic
    radiation</a> by


    `Phi_p = ((Phi_e))/((h nu))`


    where `h` is the Planck constant, and `ν` is the frequency of the corresponding
    electromagnetic wave.'
  - For a beam of radiation whose spectral distribution is `((d Phi_e ( lambda )))/((d
    lambda))` or `((d Phi_e ( nu )))/((d nu))`, the photon flux can be expressed by
    `Phi_p = int_0^(oo) ((d Phi_e ( lambda )))/((d lambda)) * (lambda)/((h c_0)) d
    lambda = int_0^(oo) ((d Phi_e ( nu )))/((d nu)) * (1)/((h nu)) d nu`, where `h`
    is Planck's constant and `c`~0~ is the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}.
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant flux". The corresponding photometric
    quantity is "luminous flux".
  - The photon flux is expressed in second to the power minus one (s^−1^).
