  notes:
  - 1 In the standardized calendar, each calendar day extends from one midnight to
    the next midnight for the standard time at a given location. Consecutive calendar
    days are usually grouped together in various time intervals, i.e. calendar weeks,
    calendar months, calendar years.
  - 2 In the standardized calendar, a calendar date is expressed by a triple of numbers
    consisting of the number of the year relative to a conventional origin, the number
    of the month within this year and the number of the day within this month. The
    standardized representation (see ISO 8601) is in the order year-month-day, as
    in the example 1998-11-15.
