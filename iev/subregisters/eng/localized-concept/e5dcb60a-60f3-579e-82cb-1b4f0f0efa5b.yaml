  notes:
  - A waveguide adapter may consist of a conveniently short length of waveguide having
    the required mating flanges. If the waveguides to be connected have different
    transverse cross-sections the adapter may also include a matching conversion section.
    If the modes of propagation also differ, the adapter may function as a mode converter.
