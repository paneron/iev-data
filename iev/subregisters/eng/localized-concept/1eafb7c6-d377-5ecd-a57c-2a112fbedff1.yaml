  notes:
  - 'The luminous turbidity factor can be expressed by


    `T_v = ((- ln ( E_((vs)) // E_v )))/((a_v m))`


    where `E`~vs~ is the direct-beam illuminance on a horizontal surface (at the ground),
    `E`~v~ is the extraterrestrial horizontal illuminance, `a`~v~ is the luminous
    extinction coefficient, and `m` is the relative optical air mass.'
  - The luminous turbidity factor has unit one.
