  definition: the location of a point associated with an antenna, if it exists, such
    that, when it is taken as the centre of a sphere or a circle, the phase of a given
    field component in the far-field region remains essentially constant at least
    over that portion of the surface of the sphere or over an arc of the circle where
    the radiation is significant

  - Some antennas have different phase centres dependent on the plane containing the
    circle being considered.
