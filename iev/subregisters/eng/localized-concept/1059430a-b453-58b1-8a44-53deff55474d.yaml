  notes:
  - 1 A particle with rest mass `m`~0~ and speed `v` has a relativistic mass equal
    to `m_0 // sqrt(1 - v^2 // c_0^2)`, where `c`~0~ is speed of light. When the speed
    `v` is non-zero, the relativistic mass is greater than the rest mass.
  - 2 In the theory of relativity, the term “mass” generally means relativistic mass.
