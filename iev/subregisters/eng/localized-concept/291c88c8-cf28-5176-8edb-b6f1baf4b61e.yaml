  definition: complex value where the real part is the refractive index and the imaginary
    part is related to the spectral absorption index `hat n ( lambda ) = n ( lambda
    ) - i kappa ( lambda )` where where `n`(`λ`) is the refractive index at wavelength
    `λ`, `κ`(`λ`) is the spectral absorption index and `i = sqrt(- 1)`
