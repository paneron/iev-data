  notes:
  - For control structures, a distinction is made between on the one hand functional
    command and communication structures and on the other hand spatial and device-related
    arrangements. In terms 351-55-09 to 351-55-11 and 351-47-38 to 351-47-40 centralized,
    decentralized and hierarchical are used exclusively in a functional sense. In
    the spatial and device-oriented sense the terms compact and distributed are used
    in 351-54-02 and 351-54-03.
