  notes:
  - Portable equipment carried by a person during its operation is sometimes referred
    to as hand-held equipment.
  - Hand-held gas detection equipment, typically less than 1 kg, requires use of only
    one hand to operate. Larger equipment that can be operated by the user while it
    is carried either by hand, by a shoulder strap or carrying harness, can be equipped
    with or without a hand directed probe.
