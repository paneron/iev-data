  notes:
  - 'The retina contains photoreceptors and nerve cells that interconnect and transmit
    to the optic nerve the signals resulting from stimulation of the photoreceptors.
    The photoreceptors in the human retina are of three types: rods and cones, which
    are responsible for vision, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
    cells (ipRGCs), which play a role in controlling circadian and neuro-endocrine
    systems.'
