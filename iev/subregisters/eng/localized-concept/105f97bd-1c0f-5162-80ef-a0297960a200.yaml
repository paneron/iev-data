  definition: the medium in which a variable electric field produces an electric current
    density vector `vec J` whose magnitude in a given direction is small relative
    to that of the vector `((del vec D))/((del t))` in a particular frequency band

  notes:
  - 'For a sinusoidal wave in an isotropic medium, the medium is dielectric if the
    following relation is satisfied:


    `(sigma)/((epsilon_0 omega)) ≪ epsilon_r^( '' )`


    where `epsilon_r^( '' )` is the relative real permittivity, `ε`~0~ is the electric
    constant, `σ` is the conductivity, `ω` is the angular frequency.'
  - An anisotropic medium may be dielectric only in certain directions.
