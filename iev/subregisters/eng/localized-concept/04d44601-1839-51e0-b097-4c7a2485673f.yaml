  definition: set of equations relating the four vector quantities determining the
    electromagnetic field in a material medium or in vacuum and the two quantities
    electric current density and volumic electric charge

  notes:
  - 'The Maxwell equations expressed in differential form are:


    `rot E = - ((del B))/((del t))`


    `div D = rho`


    `rot H = J + ((del D))/((del t))`


    `div B = 0`


    where *rot* and div denote the rotation and the divergence respectively, `*E*`
    , `*D*` , `*H*`  and `*B*`  are the four vector quantities determining the electromagnetic
    field,  `*J*` is the electric current density, `œÅ`  is the volumic electric charge
    and `t` is the time.'
  - The Maxwell equations completely define the electromagnetic field in a given medium
    only together with the relations characterizing the medium, often called constitutive
    relations; in the case of a linear medium, these relations are expressed in terms
    of the permittivity, permeability, and conductivity of the medium.
