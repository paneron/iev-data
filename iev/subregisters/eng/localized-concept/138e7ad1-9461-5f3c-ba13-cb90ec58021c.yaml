  definition: the quotient of `E` by `bar N`, where `bar N` is the mean number of
    ion pairs formed when the initial kinetic energy `E` of a charged particle is
    completely dissipated in the gas `W = (E)/(bar N)`

  notes:
  - The ions produced by the bremsstrahlung emitted by the charged particle must be
    counted in `bar N`.
