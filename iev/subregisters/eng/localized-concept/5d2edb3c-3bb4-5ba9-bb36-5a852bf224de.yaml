  definition: quotient of the <a href="IEV845-29-106">optical thickness</a> of the
    atmosphere at angle `ε` to the vertical, `δ`(`ε`), and the vertical optical thickness,
    `δ`(0°), of the atmosphere `m = ((delta ( epsilon )))/((delta ( 0 ° )))`

  notes:
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-29-106">optical thickness</a>".
  - 'Several equations are available to express this concept. Usually the Kasten–Young
    formula is used:


    `m = (1)/((sin\ gamma_s \ + \ 0, 5 0 5\ 72 ( gamma_s \ + \ 6 ,0 79\ 95 )^(- 1
    , 636 4)))`


    where `γ`~s~ (= 90° − `ε`) is solar altitude (complementary angle of zenith angle,
    `ε`) in degree.'
  - 'When the curvature of the atmosphere and atmospheric refraction are neglected:


    `m = (1)/((cos epsilon))`.'
  - The relative optical air mass has unit one.
