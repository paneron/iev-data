  definition: 'propagation duration of a {{signal, IEV:101-12-02}} between two points
    on a {{transmission path, IEV:701-02-11}} defined in terms of the {{group velocity,
    IEV:103-10-15}} by the {{line integral, IEV:102-05-03}} taken along the transmission
    path: `int (1)/((v_g)) d s` where `v`~g~ is the algebraic value of the projection
    of the group velocity vector onto the tangent to the ray path, and d`s` is the
    {{scalar line element, IEV:102-05-01}}'

  notes:
  - In a {{homogeneous, IEV:113-02-01}} medium, or on a {{uniform transmission line,
    IEV:131-12-87}}, the group delay is equal to the derivative with respect to the
    {{angular frequency, IEV:103-07-03}} of the difference, at the same time, of the
    {{phases, IEV:103-07-04}}, at the two points, of the signal used to define the
    group velocity.
  - In practice, if the medium is not too absorbent, nor too anisotropic, nor too
    dispersive, the group delay is equal to the propagation duration of the signal
    used to define the group velocity.
