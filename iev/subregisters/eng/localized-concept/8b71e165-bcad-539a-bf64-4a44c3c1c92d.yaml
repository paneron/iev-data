  definition: for a resistive two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, quotient of the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) `u`~AB~ between
    the terminals by the electric current `i` in the element or circuit `R = ((u_((AB))))/(i)`
    where the electric current is taken positive if its direction is from A to B and
    negative if its direction is from B to A

  notes:
  - A resistance cannot be negative.
  - The term "resistance" is also a short term for “resistance to alternating current”
    ({{131-12-45, IEV:131-12-45}}).
  - In French, the term "résistance" also denotes a device, in English "resistor"
    (see {{151-13-19, IEV:151-13-19}}).
  - The coherent SI unit of resistance is ohm, Ω.
