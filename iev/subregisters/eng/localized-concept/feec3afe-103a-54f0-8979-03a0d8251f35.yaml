  definition: 'quantity defined by `Phi = K_m int_0^(oo) V ( lambda ) P ( lambda )
    d lambda` where: `P`(`λ`) is the power spectral density radiated by the source
    at wavelength `λ`; `V`(`λ`) is the spectral luminous efficiency for photopic vision;
    `K`~m~ is a constant'

  notes:
  - In the SI system of units, where `P`(`λ`) is expressed in watts per metre, the
    luminous flux `Ф` is expressed in lumens, and `K`~m~ = 683 lm/W.
