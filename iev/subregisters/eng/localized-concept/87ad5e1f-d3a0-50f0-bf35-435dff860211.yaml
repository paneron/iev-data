  definition: 'functional unit with two or several inputs and one output the value
    of the output variable of which is equal to the algebraic sum of the values of
    the input variables multiplied by constant weighting factors according to the
    formula: `v ( t ) = K_1 * u_1 ( t ) + K_2 * u_2 ( t ) + ...` where<table> <tr>
    <td>`t`</td> <td>is the time;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> `K`~1~, `K`~2~ </td> <td>are
    the weighting factors;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> `u`~1~, `u`~2~ </td> <td>are the input
    variables;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>`v`</td> <td>is the summing result.</td> </tr>
