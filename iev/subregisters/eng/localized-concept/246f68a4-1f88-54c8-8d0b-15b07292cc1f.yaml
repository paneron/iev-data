  definition: radiant spherical exposure weighted with a stated photobiological action
    spectrum
  examples: []
  id: 845-26-038
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the photobiological effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - The photobiological fluence is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^).
