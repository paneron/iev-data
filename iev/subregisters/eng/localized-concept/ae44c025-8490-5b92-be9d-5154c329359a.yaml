  definition: function expressing the probability `P`(`E`), for a particle obeying
    Fermi statistics, that it will occupy a permitted energy level `E` `P ( E ) =
    (1)/((1 + exp ( ((E - E_F))/((k T)) )))` where `k` is the Boltzmann constant `T`
    is the thermodynamic temperature `E`~F~ is the Fermi-level and where this level
    is quantized and may contain 0, 1 or 2 electrons.
