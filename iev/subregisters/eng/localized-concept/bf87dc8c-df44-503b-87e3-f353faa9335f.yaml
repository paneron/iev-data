  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:485-15-01}} caused by the resistance to the flow
    of ions in the {{electrolyte, IEV:485-03-01}} and of electrons in the {{electrodes,
    IEV:485-02-01}}, {{bipolar plates, IEV:485-06-04}}, and {{current collectors,

  notes:
  - The term "ohmic" refers to the fact that the voltage drop follows {{Ohm's law,
    IEV:131-15-08}} proportional to the current with an ohmic resistance (called "{{internal
    resistance, IEV:485-15-04}}" of the cell) as the proportionality constant.
