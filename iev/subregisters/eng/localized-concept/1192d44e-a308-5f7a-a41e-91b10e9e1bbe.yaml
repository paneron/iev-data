  definition: space around {{energized, IEV:651-21-08}} parts where reduction of {{electrical
    risk, IEV:651-26-06}} is managed by restricting access to {{skilled persons, IEV:651-26-11}}
    only, by maintaining the appropriate air distances to parts at a different electric
    potential and by using {{tools, IEV:651-21-14}} for {{live working, IEV:651-21-01}}
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The distance from the energized parts to the outer boundary of a live working
    zone is greater or equal to the sum of the {{electrical distance, IEV:651-21-12}}
    appropriate for the maximum nominal voltage and of the selected {{ergonomic distance,
    IEV:651-21-13}}.
  - The live working zone and the specific precautions that apply are generally defined
    by national or company regulations.
  - This entry was numbered 651-01-06 in IEC 60050-651:1999. It has been modified
    to ensure clarification of the concept of live working.
