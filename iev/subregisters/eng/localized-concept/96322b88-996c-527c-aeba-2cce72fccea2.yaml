  definition: scalar field `U` the negative of the gradient of which is a force field
    *`F`*, thus *`F`* = −*grad* `U`

  notes:
  - 1 The potential is not unique since any constant scalar field can be added to
    a given potential without changing its gradient. See also IEC 60050-102:2007,
    {{102-05-24, IEV:102-05-24}}.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of potential is newton metre, N⋅m.
