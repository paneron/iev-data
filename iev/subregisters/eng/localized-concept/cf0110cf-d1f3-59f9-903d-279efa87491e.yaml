  definition: ratio of the active frequency region to the resonance frequency `D_L
    = ((f_L - f_r))/((f_r)) tilde= ((C_1))/((2 ( C_0 + C_L )))` where `f`~r~ is the
    resonance frequency; `f`~L~ is the load resonance frequency; `C`~1~ is the motional
    capacitance; `C`~0~ is the shunt capacitance; `C`~L~ is the load capacitance
