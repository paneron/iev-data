  definition: value showing the sharpness of the resonance, commonly used to represent
    the merit of the resonator, defined as `Q_S = ((omega_r L_1))/((R_1))` where `omega_r
    = 2 pi f_r` is the angular resonance frequency; `f`~r~ is the resonance frequency;
    `L`~1~ is the motional inductance; `R`~1~ is the motional resistance
