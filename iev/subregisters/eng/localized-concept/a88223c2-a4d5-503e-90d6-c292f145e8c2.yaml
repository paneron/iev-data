  definition: 'scalar line integral of a magnetic vector potential *`A`* along a curve
    C: `Psi = underset(C)( int ) A * d r` where d*`r`* is the vector line element'

  notes:
  - 'For a closed curve C, the linked flux is equal to the magnetic flux through any
    surface S bounded by the curve:


    `underset(C)( oint ) A * d r = underset(S)( int ) B * e_n d A`


    where *`B`* is the magnetic flux density and *`e`*~n~d`A` the vector surface element.'
  - For a coil with N turns, the linked flux is approximately equal to `NΦ` where
    `Φ` is the magnetic flux through any surface bounded by one turn.
