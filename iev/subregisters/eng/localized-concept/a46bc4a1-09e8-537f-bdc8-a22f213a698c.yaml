  notes:
  - The sampling aperture is delimited by the area illuminated, or by the area over
    which the receiver senses flux, whichever is smaller. If the illuminated area
    is the larger, the area measured is said to be "overfilled"; if it is the smaller,
    the area measured is said to be "underfilled".
