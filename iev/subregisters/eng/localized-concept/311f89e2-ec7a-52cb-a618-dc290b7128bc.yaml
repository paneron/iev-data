  notes:
  - For a three-phase line under symmetric and sinusoidal conditions, the active power
    is `P = U I sqrt(3) cos varphi`, where `U` is the RMS value of any line-to-line
    voltage, `I` is the RMS value of any line current and `Ï•`  is the displacement
    angle between any line-to-neutral voltage and the corresponding line current.
