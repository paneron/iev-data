  definition: 'mathematical expression used for the evaluation of characteristics
    of magnetic materials and expressed in decibels by: `T H D_F = 20 lg ( ((V_m //
    V_f))/((mu_((ea)) // C C F)) )` where `V_m = sqrt(sum_((n = 1))^(oo) V_n^2)`,
    where `Vn` is the amplitude of the `n`-th harmonic component of the waveform,
    `V`~f~ is the amplitude of its fundamental component, `μ`~ea~ is the amplitude
    permeability, `CCF` is the Circuit Correction Factor'

  notes:
  - In practice, `C C F = 1 // sqrt(1 + ( 3 omega L_1 // R_s )^2)` stands for the
    Circuit Correction Factor and is given in the approximation for the third harmonic,
    which is valid for measurements without applied DC bias. `L`~1~ is the primary
    inductance. `R`~s~ is the total source resistance (50 Ω).
  - '`THD`~F~ is sometimes expressed in decibels.'
