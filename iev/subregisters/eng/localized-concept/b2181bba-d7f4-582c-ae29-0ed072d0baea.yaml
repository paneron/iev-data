  definition: ratio of the phasor representing the reflected electric current to the
    phasor representing the incident current at a port of an electric network or close
    to a discontinuity in a transmission line

  notes:
  - 'When impedances can be defined, the complex current reflection factor equals:


    `(underset(_)(r))_I = ((underset(_)(Z) - underset(_)(Z) ''))/((underset(_)(Z)
    + underset(_)(Z) ''))`


    where <u>`Z`</u> is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line ahead
    of the discontinuity or the impedance of the source, and <u>`Z`</u>â€² is the impedance
    after the discontinuity or the load impedance seen from the junction between the
    source and the load.'
  - The term "complex current reflection factor" may be shortened by omitting the
    qualifier "complex" in an appropriate context.
