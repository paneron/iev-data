  notes:
  - Remote control can be achieved by using a hand-held transmitter that communicates
    by electromagnetic or sonic means with a receiver that is part of the appliance.
  - Remote control enables authorized persons, such as family members, carers, friends
    and neighbours, to help at any time, whether this relates to the activation of
    a rarely used function of a product or in case the cooking plate has not been
    switched off. Assistance by means of a remote control can also be helpful with
    complex operating sequences or in the event of a failure.
