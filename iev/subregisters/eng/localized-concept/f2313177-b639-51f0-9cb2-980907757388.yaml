  definition: 'functional unit that generates the manipulated variable, required to
    drive the final controlling element, from the output variable of the controlling
    element SEE: Figures 1 and 2.'
  examples:
  - ': A practical example of an actuator acting directly on the final controlling
    element is a DC drive. The control unit takes the function of an actuator. The
    final controlling element is formed by the thyristor assembly that delivers a
    variable DC voltage as an output variable. The control unit and the thyristor
    assembly together form the final controlling equipment.'

  notes:
  - If the final controlling element is mechanically actuated, it is controlled via
    an actuating drive. The actuator drives the actuating drive in this case.
