  definition: representation of a real or complex function `f`(`t`) of the real variable
    `t` by the integral transformation `f ( t ) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_( - oo)^( + oo)
    F ( omega ) e^(j omega t) d omega` where `F ( omega )` is the Fourier transform
    of the function `f ( t )` and j is the imaginary unit
