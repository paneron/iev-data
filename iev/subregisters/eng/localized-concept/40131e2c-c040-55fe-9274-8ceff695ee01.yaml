  notes:
  - Ordinal quantities can enter into empirical relations only and have neither units
    of measurement nor dimension. Differences and ratios of ordinal quantities have
    no physical meaning.
  - Ordinal quantities are arranged according to ordinal value scales.
  - 'Examples: Rockwell C hardness, octane number for petroleum fuel, earthquake strength
    on the Richter scale, subjective level of abdominal pain on a scale from zero
    to five.'
