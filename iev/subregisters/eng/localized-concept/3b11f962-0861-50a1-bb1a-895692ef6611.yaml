  definition: for a cross-section of an optical fibre the area within which the refractive
    index everywhere (excluding any index dip) exceeds that of the innermost homogeneous
    cladding by a given fraction of the difference between the maximum of the refractive
    index of the core and the refractive index of the innermost homogenous cladding

  notes:
  - 'The core area is the smallest cross-sectional area of a fibre excluding any index
    dip, which is contained within the locus of points where the refractive index
    `n`~3~ is given by:


    `n`~3~ = `n`~2~ + `k` (`n`~1~ – `n`~2~)


    where:


    `n`~1~ is maximum refractive index of the core,


    `n`~2~ is refractive index of the innermost homogeneous cladding,


    `k` is a constant (usually taken to be in the range 0 – 0,05).'
