  notes:
  - Through-silicon-vias are mainly applied to three-dimensionally stacked {{packaging,
    IEV:523-06-06}} of {{semiconductor devices, IEV:521-04-01}}. In the MEMS fields,
    the through-silicon-vias are applied to {{wafer level packaging, IEV:523-06-07}}
    technology. Some through-silicon-vias consist of through-via, insulator and {{electrode,
    IEV:151-13-01}} material. Solder, copper, doped-poly-silicon and so on are used
    as electrode materials.
