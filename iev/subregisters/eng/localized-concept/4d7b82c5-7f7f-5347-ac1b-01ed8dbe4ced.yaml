  definition: mean value of the {{transinformation content, IEV:171-07-26}} `T`(`xi`,`xj`)
    of two events `xi` and `yj`, each in one of two finite sets of mutually exclusive
    and jointly exhaustive events `T ( X , Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p
    ( x_i , y_j ) * T ( x_i , y_j )` where `X` = {`x`~1~, …, `x`~`n`~} is the set
    of events `xi` (`i` = 1, …, `n`), `Y` = {`y`~1~, …, `y`~`m`~} is the set of events
    `yj` (`j` = 1, …, `m`) and `p`(`xi`,`yj`) the joint probability that both events
    occur

  notes:
  - 'The mean transinformation content is symmetric in `X` and `Y`. It is also equal
    to the difference between the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} of one of the two sets
    of events and the {{conditional entropy, IEV:171-07-23}} of this set relative
    to the other: `T ( X | Y ) = H ( X ) - H ( X | Y ) = H ( Y ) - H ( Y | X ) = T
    ( X | Y )`.'
  - The mean transinformation content is a quantitative measure of information transmitted
    through a channel, when `X` is a specific set of messages at the message source
    and `Y` is a specific set of messages at the message sink. It is equal to the
    difference between the entropy at the message source and the {{equivocation, IEV:171-07-24}},
    or the difference between the entropy at the message sink and the {{irrelevance,
    IEV:171-07-25}}.
