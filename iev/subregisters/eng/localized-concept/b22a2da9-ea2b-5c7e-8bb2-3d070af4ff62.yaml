  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The distribution in the far-field region is most frequently considered.
  - The quantity which characterizes the field, may be for instance the magnitude
    of a specified component of the electromagnetic field or of the field strength-distance
    product, the radiation intensity, the directivity, the absolute gain or a relative
    gain.
  - In French, the term "caractéristique de directivité" is the preferred term when
    the quantity used to characterize the field does not depend upon the power fed
    to the antenna.
