  definition: quotient of the {{character mean transinformation content, IEV:171-07-30}}
    `T`^′^ by the mean duration of a pair of input and output characters `T`^*^ =
    `T`^′^/`t`(`X`,`Y`) where `X` = {`x`~1~, …, `x`~`n`~} is the set of input characters
    `xi` (`i` = 1, …, `n`), `Y` = {`y`~1~, …, `y`~`m`~} is the set of output characters
    `yj` (`j` = 1, …, `m`) and `t ( X , Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p (
    x_i , y_j ) * t ( x_i , y_j )` is the mean value of the duration `t`(`xi`,`yj`)
    of the pair of characters (`xi`,`yj`) which occurs with joint probability `p`(`xi`,`yj`).

  notes:
  - The average transinformation rate can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon
    per character and second.
