  notes:
  - Several coverage areas may be associated with the same space station, for example
    a satellite with several antennas beams.
  - In the absence of interference, the coverage area will be bounded by a contour
    of pre-determined power flux density.
  - The concept of “coverage area”, as defined here, applies in a simple way only
    to space stations on board satellites which are geostationary.
