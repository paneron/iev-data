  definition: for an integral element the reciprocal of the integral action coefficient
    if its input and output variables are variable quantities of same kind
  examples: []
  id: 351-50-10
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - 'The integral action time then is given by


    `T_I = (1)/((K_I))`


    where `K`~I~ is the integral action coefficient.'
  - The integral action time can also be given as the duration of the time interval
    required by the step response of an integral element to vary itself about the
    value of the stepwise variation of its input variable.
