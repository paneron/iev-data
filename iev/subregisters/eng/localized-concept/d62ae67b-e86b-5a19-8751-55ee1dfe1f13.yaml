  definition: polyphase system in which the `m` quantities have the same amplitude
    and initial phases given by `vartheta_0 - 2 pi ((( i - 1 ) k))/(m)` where `vartheta_0`
    is the initial phase of one of the quantities which is arbitrarily chosen out
    of the set `i` = 1, 2, ..., `m`, and `k` is a characteristic of the system, equal
    to one of the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., `m` âˆ’ 1

  notes:
  - The symmetric polyphase system is a degenerated polyphase system for `k` = 0 and
    for some combinations of `k` and `m`.
