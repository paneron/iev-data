  definition: '`p_c = ((L_d))/((L_n + L_d))` where `L`~d~ and `L`~n~ are the respective
    luminances of the monochromatic stimulus and of the specified achromatic stimulus
    that match the colour stimulus considered in an additive mixture'

  notes:
  - In the case of purple stimuli, the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    whose chromaticity is represented by a point on the purple boundary.
  - In the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system, colorimetric purity, `p`~c~, is
    related to excitation purity, `p`~e~, by the equation `p`~c~Â = `p`~e~`y`~d~/`y`
    where `y`~d~ and `y` are the `y` chromaticity coordinates respectively, of the
    monochromatic stimulus and the colour stimulus considered.
  - In the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric system, a measure, `p`~c,10~, is defined
    by the relation given in Note 2 to entry, but using `p`~e,10~, `y`~d,10~ and `y`~10~
    instead of `p`~e~, `y`~d~, and `y` respectively.
  - This entry was numbered 845-03-47 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
