  definition: that region of the electromagnetic field of an antenna wherein the predominant
    components of the field are those which represent a propagation of energy and
    wherein the angular field distribution is essentially independent of the distance
    from the antenna

  notes:
  - In the far field region, all the components of the electromagnetic field decrease
    in inverse proportion to the distance from the antenna.
  - For a broadside antenna having a maximum overall dimension `D` which is large
    compared to the wavelength `λ`, the far field region is commonly taken to exist
    at distances greater than 2`D`^2^/`λ`, from the antenna in the direction of maximum
    radiation.
