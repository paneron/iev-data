  definition: limit, if it exists, of the quotient of the mean number of failures
    of a repairable item within time interval (`t`, `t` + Δ`t`), by Δ`t`, when Δ`t`
    tends to zero `z ( t ) = underset((Delta t -> 0 +))((lim)) ((E N ( t + Delta t
    ) - N ( t ) ))/((Delta t))` where `N`(`t`) is the number of failures in the time
    interval (0, `t`), where `E` denotes the expectation.
