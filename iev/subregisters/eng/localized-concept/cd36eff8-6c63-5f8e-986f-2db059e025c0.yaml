  notes:
  - In information theory, the concept "event" is to be understood as used in the
    theory of probability. For instance, an event can be:* the presence of a specific
    element in a given set of elements;* the occurrence of a specific character or
    word in a given message or in a given position of a message;* any one of the distinct
    results an experiment can yield.
