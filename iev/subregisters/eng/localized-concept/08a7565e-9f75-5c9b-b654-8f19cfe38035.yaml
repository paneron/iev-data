  definition: real number `ϑ` such that 0 ≤ `ϑ` ≤ π, the cosine of which is the ratio
    of the scalar product of two given real vectors *`U`* and *`V`* to the product
    of their magnitudes `vartheta = arccos ((U * V))/((| U | * | V |))`

  notes:
  - The angle of two vectors is always defined because the inequality `| U * V | &lt;=
    | U | * | V |` is valid for the scalar product.
