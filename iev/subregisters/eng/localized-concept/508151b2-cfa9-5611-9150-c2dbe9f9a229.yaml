  notes:
  - 'There are several kinds of intervals:




    * closed interval from `a` to `b`: `a , b = { x in R | a &lt;= x &lt;= b }`


    * open interval from `a` to `b`: `a , b = { x in R | a x b }`


    * half-open intervals: `a , b = { x in R | a x &lt;= b }` and `a , b = { x in
    R | a &lt;= x b }`


    * closed unbounded interval up to `b` or onward from `a`: `- oo , b = { x in R
    | x &lt;= b }` and `a , + oo = { x in R | a &lt;= x }`


    * open unbounded interval up to `b` or onward from `a`: `- oo , b = { x in R |
    x b }` and `a , + oo = { x in R | a x }`'
