  definition: time-average of the instantaneous intensity at a particular point in
    an acoustic field

  notes:
  - Time average is taken usually over an integral number of acoustic repetition periods;
    if not, the averaging period should be specified.
  - In a plane acoustical wave in a non-absorbing fluid medium, acoustic intensity
    is the same at all points of the wave, when averaged over a complete cycle.
  - In a perfect standing wave, temporal-average intensity is zero.
  - (relating to ultrasonic medical diagnostic systems) In principle, the temporal-average
    intensity is an average over a relatively long time interval. For non-auto-scanning
    systems, the instantaneous intensity may be averaged over one or more pulse-repetition
    periods. For auto-scanning systems, the instantaneous intensity may be averaged
    over one or more scan-repetition periods for a specified operating mode.
