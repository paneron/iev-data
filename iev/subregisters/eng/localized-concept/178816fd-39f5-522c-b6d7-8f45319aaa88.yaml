  definition: the transmission loss, usually expressed in decibels, that would occur
    if the antennas were replaced by isotropic antennas located in a perfectly dielectric,
    homogeneous, isotropic and unlimited environment, the distance between the antennas
    being retained

  notes:
  - 'If the distance d between the antennas is much greater than the wavelength `Î»`,
    the free-space attenuation in decibels will be:


    `A_0 = 20 log ( ((4 pi d))/(lambda) )`'
