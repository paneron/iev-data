  definition: function describing the change with direction of irradiation (`θ`~i~,`ϕ`~i~)
    and direction of view (`θ`~r~,`ϕ`~r~) of the radiance of a surface element (`x`~r~,`y`~r~)
    in a given direction of view at a given wavelength `λ`, `L_r ( theta_r , varphi_r
    , x_r , y_r , lambda )`, with respect to the irradiance incident on the medium
    from the given direction of irradiation at the given wavelength, `E_i ( theta_i
    , varphi_i , lambda )` `rho ( theta_i , varphi_i , theta_r , varphi_r , x_r ,
    y_r , lambda ) = ((d L_r ( theta_r , varphi_r , x_r , y_r , lambda )))/((d E_i
    ( theta_i , varphi_i , lambda )))`

  notes:
  - The bi-directional reflectance distribution function is expressed in steradian
    to the power minus one (sr^−1^).
