  notes:
  - The term "memory" is used with a qualifier for various types of storage devices
    and for an addressable storage space (see {{IEV 171-01-27, IEV:171-01-27}}). In
    French, the term is always "m√©moire".
  - A specialized definition for control technology is given in {{IEV 351-50-40, IEV:351-50-40}},
    with the preferred term "storage element" and the synonyms "storage" and "memory".
