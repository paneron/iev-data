  definition: under sinusoidal conditions, product of the phasor `underset(_)(U)`
    representing the voltage between the terminals of a linear two-terminal element
    or two-terminal circuit and the complex conjugate of the phasor `underset(_)(I)`
    representing the electric current in the element or circuit `underset(_)(S) =
    underset(_)(U) underset(_)(I) *`

  notes:
  - Complex power is equal to `P + j Q`, where `P` is active power and `Q` is reactive
    power.
  - The coherent SI unit for complex power is voltampere, VA.
