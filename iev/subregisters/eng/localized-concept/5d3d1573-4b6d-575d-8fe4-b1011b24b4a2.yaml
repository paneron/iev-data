  definition: complex quantity representing a real quantity which varies sinusoidally
    with time (such as sound pressure, vibration velocity, voltage), or the quotient
    of two such complex quantities of the same frequency, which can be expressed in
    the form (`a`+`jb`) with real part `a` and imaginary part `b`, or as a phasor
    Ae ^`j`θ^ with modulus `A` and argument θ

  notes:
  - Throughout this section, all parameters (mechanical, acoustic, or electric) are
    considered to be complex, unless specified otherwise.
  - The convention of +`j` is observed here, whereby a positive-going sine wave is
    represented by `Re`(`e` ^`j`(ω`t`-`kx`)^) a mass reactance by +`j`ω`M`, and a
    stiffness reactance by -`jS`/ω. Wave number `k` = ω/`c` is the quotient of angular
    frequency ω by speed of sound `c`; mass `M`; stiffness `S`.
