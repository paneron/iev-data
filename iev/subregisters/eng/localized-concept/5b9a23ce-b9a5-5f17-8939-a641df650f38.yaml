  definition: 'at a given point within a domain of quasi-infinitesimal volume `V`,
    vector quantity equal to the magnetic area moment `*m*` of the substance contained
    within the domain divided by the volume `V`: `M = (m)/(V)`'

  notes:
  - 'The magnetization `*M*` satisfies the relation


    `*B*` = `μ`~0~(`*H*` + `*M*`)


    where `*B*` is the magnetic flux density, `*H*`  the magnetic field strength and
    `μ`~0~ the magnetic constant.'
