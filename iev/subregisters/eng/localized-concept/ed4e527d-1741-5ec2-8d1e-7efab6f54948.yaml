  definition: scalar constant `μ`~0~ linking the electromagnetic quantities and the
    mechanical quantities, obtained from the relation `(F)/(l) = ((mu_0))/((2 pi))
    * ((| I_1 I_2 |))/(d)` where `F/l` is the magnitude of the lineic force between
    two straight parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible circular cross-section,
    placed at a distance `d` apart in vacuum and carrying electric currents `I`~1~
    and `I`~2~

  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the product of the magnetic constant and the magnetic field strength
    `*H*` is equal to the magnetic flux density `*B*`:


    `*B*` = `μ`~0~`*H*`'
  - 'The magnetic constant is related to the electric constant `ε`~0~ and to the speed
    of light in vacuum `c`~0~ by the relation


    `μ`~0~`ε`~0~`c`~0~^2^ = 1'
  - 'The value of the magnetic constant is exactly equal to


    4π × 10^−7^ m kg s^−2^ A^−2^ = 1,256 637 061 4... μH/m'
