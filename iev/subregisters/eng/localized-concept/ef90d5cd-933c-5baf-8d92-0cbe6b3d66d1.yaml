  definition: for any vector *`U`*, non-negative scalar, usually denoted by `| U |`,
    equal to the non-negative square root of the scalar product or, in the case of
    a complex vector, of the Hermitian product of the vector by itself

  notes:
  - "The magnitude of a vector *`U`* has the following properties:\n\n\n\n* `U = 0`\
    \ if and only if `| U | = 0`,\n\n* `| alpha U | = | alpha | * | U |` where `α`\
    \ is a scalar, \n\n* `| U + V | &lt;= | U | + | V |` where *`V`* is any other\
    \ vector."
  - For a vector *`U`* in the three-dimensional Euclidean or Hermitian space with
    orthonormal base, the magnitude is given by `| U | = sqrt(| U_1 |^2 + | U_2 |^2
    + | U_3 |^2)`.
  - The terms "Euclidean norm" and "Hermitian norm" may be used for the real or the
    complex case, respectively.
  - The magnitude of a vector *`U`* is represented by `| U |` or by `U`; `‖ U ‖` is
    also used.
