  definition: quotient of the irradiance or illuminance, `E`~2~ (or `E`~1~), at a
    point on surface S~2~ (or S~1~) due to the flux received from surface S~1~ (or
    S~2~) and the radiant exitance or luminous exitance, `M`~1~ (or `M`~2~), of surface
    S~1~ (or S~2~) `c_((21)) = ((E_2))/((M_1))` or `c_((12)) = ((E_1))/((M_2))`

  notes:
  - 'The relation between the configuration factor, `c`, and the (mutual) exchange
    coefficient, `g`, is


    `underset((A_2))( int ) c_((21)) d A_2 = ((underset((A_2))( int ) E_2 d A_2))/((M_1))
    = ((Phi_2))/((M_1)) = g = ((Phi_1))/((M_2)) = ((underset((A_1))( int ) E_1 d A_1))/((M_2))
    = underset((A_1))( int ) c_((12)) d A_1`


    where `Φ`~2~ (or `Φ`~1~) is the flux received over surface S~2~ (or S~1~) from
    surface S~1~ (or S~2~) and `A`~2~ (or `A`~1~) is the area of surface S~2~ (or
    S~1~)'
  - The configuration factor has unit one.
