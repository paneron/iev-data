  notes:
  - The wavelength has its minimum value in the direction of propagation; if no direction
    is specified. the wavelength is that in the direction of propagation.
  - The wavelength in any direction is 2`Ï€` divided by the absolute value of the component,
    in this direction, of the real part of the wave vector.
