  definition: for a plane surface, scalar quantity equal to the second axial moment
    of area `I`~a~ with respect to a specified axis Q in the plane of the surface,
    divided by the maximum radial distance `r`~Q, max~ of any point in the surface
    considered from the Q-axis, thus `Z = ((I_a))/((r_((Q, max))))`
