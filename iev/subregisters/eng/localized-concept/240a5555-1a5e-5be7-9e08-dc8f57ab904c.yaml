  definition: 'algebraic equation giving the number d`N` of particles of a quantized
    system in equilibrium, the velocity components of which are included in the intervals
    (`u`, `u` + d`u`), (`v`, `v` + d`v`), (`w`, `w` + d`w`) : respectively: `d N =
    2 N * ((m^3))/((h^3)) * ((d u * d v * d w))/((1 + exp ( ((E - E_M))/((k T)) )))`
    where `N` is the total number of particles `m` is the mass of the particle `T`
    is the thermodynamic temperature `k` is the Boltzmann constant `h` is the Planck
    constant `E` is the kinetic energy of a particle, `E = (m)/(2) ( u^2 + v^2 + w^2
    )` `E`~M~ is the inner work function d`N`/`N` represents the probability that
    a particle has its components within the intervals considered.'
