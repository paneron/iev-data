  definition: representation of a real or complex function `f`(`t`) of the real variable
    `t` by the integral transformation `f ( t ) = (1)/((2 pi j)) int_( sigma - j oo)^(
    sigma + j oo) F ( s ) e^(s t) d s` where `F ( s )` is the Laplace transform of
    the function `f`(`t`), `Ïƒ` is greater or equal to the abscissa of convergence
    of `F ( s )` and j is the imaginary unit
