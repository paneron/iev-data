    a) numbering system: assigned numbers used to denote the size of the contact and
    its related conductor accommodation,


    b) current rating system: the related current-carrying capacity is used to denote
    the size of the contact,


    c) cross-sectional area system: reference is made to the cross-sectional area
    of the maximum conductor accommodation to denote the size of the contact.'
