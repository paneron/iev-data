  notes:
  - For a {{micromachine, IEV:523-01-03}} to perform mechanical work, the microactuator
    is indispensable as a basic {{component, IEV:151-11-21}}. Major examples are the
    electrostatic actuator prepared by a silicon process, the {{piezoelectric actuator,
    IEV:523-04-10}} that utilizes functional materials like lead zirconate titanate
    (PZT), the pneumatic rubber-actuator, and so on. Many other actuators based on
    various energy conversion principles have been investigated and developed. However,
    the energy conversion efficiency of all these actuators deteriorates as their
    size is reduced. Therefore, the motion mechanisms of organisms such as the deformation
    of protein molecules, the flagellar movement of bacteria, and muscle contraction
    are being utilized to develop special new actuators for micromachines.
  - Micro-electrostatic actuators are actuated by a micro-electrostatic field, magnetic
    microactuators are driven by a micromagnetic field, and piezoelectric microactuators
    depend on a microstress field to convey motion and power.
