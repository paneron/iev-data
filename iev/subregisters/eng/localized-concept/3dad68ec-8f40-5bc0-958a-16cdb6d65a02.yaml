  notes:
  - Micromoulding is a microforming process that uses such means as compression, transfer,
    injection, and blowing to form a desired shape in a metallic mould. Microshapes
    are created by feeding raw materials such as polymers and ceramics into a mould.
    In the {{LIGA process, IEV:523-05-06}}, plastics are formed in a metallic mould
    using precision moulding technology. In a typical example, a low-viscosity plastic
    is degassed and fed into the vacuum mould under high pressure to prevent bubbling
    and to fill small gaps completely. Heat treatment is performed at high temperature
    under high pressure to cure the plastics, to release the stress, and to compensate
    for shrinkage. The plastic structures made with this reaction injection moulding
    technology can be plated and used themselves as moulds to produce metallic structures.
