  notes:
  - With `A`~`i`~ as the Sabine absorption of the `i`-th surface or object or medium
    in a room, room absorption is `A` = Σ `A`~`i`~.
  - 'Sabine absorption due to dissipation in the medium, in a room of volume `V`,
    is:


    `A_m = (4)/((1 0 l o g_((10)) e)) alpha V = 0,921 alpha V`


    where:


    `α` is the attenuation coefficient of the medium in decibels per unit length.'
