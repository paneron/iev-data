  notes:
  - The specified data elements depend on the organization of the storage device,
    for example, {{binary elements, IEV:171-02-10}}, {{bytes, IEV:171-02-12}}, {{words,
    IEV:171-02-27}} of a given number of bits, {{blocks, IEV:721-03-11}}. A subscript
    referring to a specified data element can be added to the symbol.
