  definition: phenomenon in which, in the absence of an applied magnetic field, the
    magnetic area moments of identical neighbouring atoms or ions in a substance are
    held, due to their interactions, in a cancelling arrangement such that the resultant
    magnetic area moment is zero and in which an applied magnetic field changes the
    direction of some of the magnetic area moments so that there exists a resultant
    magnetic area moment that increases with the magnetic field strength up to a certain
    limit
