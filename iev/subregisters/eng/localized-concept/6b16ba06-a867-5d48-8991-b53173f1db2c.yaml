  definition: 'unique positive value, if it exists, associated with a three-dimensional
    domain, with the following properties: * for a rectangular parallelepiped, the
    value is the product of the three side lengths, * for a disjoint union of domains,
    the value is the sum of the values associated to these domains, * for more complicated
    domains, the value can be approximated by sums and given by an integral'

  notes:
  - The volume `V` of the three-dimensional domain D is determined by the volume integral
    `underset(D)( âˆ­ ) d V`, where d`V` is the volume element ({{IEV 102-05-10, IEV:102-05-10}}).
  - In the usual geometrical space, the volume is a quantity of dimension length cubed.
