  definition: superconductor which exists in the Meissner state when the magnetic
    field strength is below the lower critical field strength, `H`~c1~, exists in
    the mixed state for the field between `H`~c1~ and the upper critical field strength,
    `H`~c2~, and exists in the normal state above `H`~c2~, when demagnetization factor
    is zero
