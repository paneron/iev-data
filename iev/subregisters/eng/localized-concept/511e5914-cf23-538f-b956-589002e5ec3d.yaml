  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between the peak value
    of the magnetic field strength `hat H_(alpha)` measured at an angle `Î±` to the
    direction of rolling, and the peak value of the magnetic field strength `hat H_0`
    measured along the direction of rolling, to `hat H_0`, at a stated peak value
    of the magnetic flux density, the ratio being expressed as a percentage: `T_H
    = ((hat H_(alpha) - hat H_0))/((hat H_0)) xx 100 %`'

  notes:
  - The measurements of `hat H_(alpha)` and`hat H_0` are to be made under the same
    conditions.
