  definition: density of incident photon number with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface `H_p = ((d N_p))/((d A))` where `N`~p~ is photon number
    and `A` is the area on which the photons are incident

  notes:
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exposure". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "luminous exposure".
  - The photon exposure is expressed in metre to the power minus two (m^âˆ’2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-44 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
