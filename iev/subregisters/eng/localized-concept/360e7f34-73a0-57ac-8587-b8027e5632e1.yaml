  definition: 'in an optical fibre a dimensionless quantity, denoted by `V`, given
    by `V = ((2 pi a))/(lambda) ( n_1^2 - n_2^2 )^(1 // 2)` where: `a` is the fibre
    core radius, `Î»` is wavelength in vacuum, and `n`~1~ and `n`~2~ are the maximum
    refractive index in the core and refractive index of the innermost homogenous
    cladding, respectively'
