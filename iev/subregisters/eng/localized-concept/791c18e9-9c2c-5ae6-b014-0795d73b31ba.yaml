  definition: 'quantity `R`~eq~, having the dimensions of resistance, used to express
    the equivalent noise voltage `E`~n~ of a one port device through the relationship:
    `R_((eq)) = ((E_n^2))/((4 k T_0 Delta f))` where `T`~0~ is a reference thermodynamic
    temperature, fixed by convention around 290 K, Î”`f` is the bandwidth considered
    and `k` is Boltzmann''s constant'

  notes:
  - A receiving antenna can be regarded as a one-port device when viewed from its
    output port.
