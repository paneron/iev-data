  notes:
  - If the wavelength is used to characterize a monochromatic radiation, the medium
    has to be stated.
  - In practice, monochromatic radiation is radiation of a very small range of frequencies
    or wavelengths that can be described by stating a single frequency or wavelength.
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-07 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
