  notes:
  - A system is generally defined with the view of achieving a given objective, for
    example by performing a definite function.
  - Elements of a system may be natural or man-made material objects, as well as modes
    of thinking and the results thereof (for example forms of organisation, mathematical
    methods, programming languages).
  - The system is considered to be separated from the environment and the other external
    systems by an imaginary surface, through which pass the links between them and
    the considered system.
  - The term "system" should be qualified when it is not clear from the context to
    what it refers, for example control system, calorimetric system, system of units,
    transmission system.
