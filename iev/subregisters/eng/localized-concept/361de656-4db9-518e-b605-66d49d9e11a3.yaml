  definition: 'at a given point within a domain of quasi-infinitesimal volume `V`,
    vector quantity equal to the electric dipole moment `*p*` of the substance contained
    within the domain divided by the volume `V`: `P = (p)/(V)`'

  notes:
  - 'The electric polarization `*P*` satisfies the relation


    `*D*` = `ε`~0~`*E*` + `*P*`


    where `*D*` is the electric flux density, `*E*`  the electric field strength and
    `ε`~0~ the electric constant.'
