        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  dateAmended: 2019-03-01
  definition: quantitative measure of {{information, IEV:171-07-03}} about the occurrence
    of an event `x` of definite probability `p`(`x`), equal to the logarithm of the
    reciprocal of this probability `I ( x ) = log (1)/((p ( x ))) = - log p ( x )`
  examples:
  - 'Let `{ a , b , c }` be a set of three events and let `p ( a ) = 0,5`, `p ( b
    ) = 0,25` and `p ( c ) = 0,25` be the probabilities of their occurrences. The
    information contents of these events are: `I ( a ) = lb (1)/((0,50)) Sh = 1 Sh`,
    `I ( b ) = lb (1)/((0,25)) Sh = 2 Sh`, `I ( c ) = lb (1)/((0,25)) Sh = 2 Sh`.'

  notes:
  - For a set of equiprobable events, the information content of each event is equal
    to the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}} of the set.
