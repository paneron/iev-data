  notes:
  - The {{process, IEV:904-01-05}} of design and development usually follows a series
    of defined steps starting with an initial idea, transforming that into a formal
    specification, and resulting in the creation of a working prototype and whatever
    documentation is required to support production of the goods or provision of the
    service.
