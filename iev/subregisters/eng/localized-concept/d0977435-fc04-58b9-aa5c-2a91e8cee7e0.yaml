  definition: in an optical fibre, a mode whose field decays monotonically in the
    transverse direction everywhere external to the core and which does not lose power
    to radiation

  notes:
  - 'Where the refractive index decreases with distance from the axis and where there
    is no central refractive index dip a bound mode is one for which :


    `n`(`a`)`k` ≤ `β` ≤ `n`(0)`k`


    where `β` is the imaginary part (phase coefficient) of the axial propagation coefficient,


    `n`(`a`) is the refractive index at `r` = `a`, the radius,


    `n`(0) is the refractive index at `r` = 0,


    `k` is the angular free space wavenumber 2 π/λ and λ is the wavelength.'
  - Bound modes correspond to guided light rays in the terminology of geometric optics.
  - In a multimode fibre, the power in bound modes is predominantly contained in the
    core of the fibre.
