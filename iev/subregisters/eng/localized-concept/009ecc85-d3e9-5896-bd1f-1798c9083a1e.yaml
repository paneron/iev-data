  definition: empirical law which describes the pinning force density as separable
    functions of temperature `T` and magnetic flux density, `B`

  notes:
  - The pinning force density, `F`~p~, is typically given by `F`~p~ ∝ &amp;lsqb;`B`~c2~(`T`)&amp;rsqb;^`m`^`f`(`b`),
    where `m` is a real number, `f`(`b`) is a function of the reduced magnetic flux
    density `b` = `B`/`B`~c2~ and `B`~c2~ = `μ`~0~`H`~c2~, where `μ`~0~ is the magnetic
    constant and `H`~c2~ is the upper critical field strength.
