  notes:
  - The term "middleware" also denotes a distribution platform, i.e. a {{protocol,
    IEV:351-56-14}} at a higher level than that of ordinary computer communication.
  - In contrast to lower-level network services handling simple communication between
    computers, middleware supports the communication between processes.
  - In the AAL context, AAL middleware provides components and services for AAL applications.
