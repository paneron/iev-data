  definition: value of deceleration `Î³`~a~ obtained by dividing the reduction in speed
    by the time taken to effect it `gamma_a = ((V_i - V_t))/(t)` where `V`~i~ is the
    initial speed measured at the moment of the operation of the control device for
    the brake; `V`~t~ is the final speed obtained at the end of the braking; `t` is
    the time between the moment of operation of the control device for the brake and
    the moment at which the final speed is attained
