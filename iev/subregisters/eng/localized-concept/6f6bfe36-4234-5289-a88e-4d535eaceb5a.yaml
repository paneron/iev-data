  definition: number the product of which by the reduced Planck constant is the value
    of the component of the spin ({{113-05-09, IEV:113-05-09}}) onto a quantization
    axis

  notes:
  - 1 In the quantization direction `z`, the component of the spin is quantized as
    `S`~`z`~ = `m`~`s`~`ħ`, `m`~`s`~ = `s`, `s` − 1, …, − `s`, where `m`~`s`~ is spin
    magnetic quantum number and `s` is spin quantum number.
  - 2 The quantization direction often can be chosen arbitrarily. In the presence
    of a magnetic field, the best choice for the quantization axis is the direction
    of the magnetic flux density.
