  notes:
  - The term “tropospheric propagation” denotes any propagation within the troposphere
    and by extension beneath the ionosphere when not influenced by the ionosphere.
  - Radio-relay systems operate at frequencies above 30 MHz and, in the most cases,
    above 1 GHz, i.e. in microwaves.
