  definition: 'complex function whose {{real part, IEV:102-02-11}} is the real function
    `f`(`t`) representing a signal and whose imaginary part is the Hilbert transform
    `g`(`t`) of the function `f`(`t`): `f ( t ) + j g ( t ) = f ( t ) - (j)/(pi) int_(-
    oo)^(+ oo) ((f ( t )))/((tau - t)) d tau`'

  notes:
  - The real part `f`(`t`) of an analytic signal is the opposite of the Hilbert transform
    of the imaginary part `g`(`t`).
  - If it exists, the complex {{Fourier transform, IEV:103-04-01}} of an analytic
    signal is zero for all negative frequencies so that, for instance, the analytic
    signal can be used to represent a single sideband modulated signal.
