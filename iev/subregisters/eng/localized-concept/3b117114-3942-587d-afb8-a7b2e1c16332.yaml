        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  dateAmended: 2019-03-01
  definition: amount by which the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}} `H`~0~ exceeds
    the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} `H` `R` = `H`~0~ − `H`
  examples:
  - 'Let `{ a , b , c }` be a set of three events and let `p ( a ) = 0,5`, `p ( b
    ) = 0,25` and `p ( c ) = 0,25` be the probabilities of their occurrences. The
    redundancy of this set is: `R = 1,585 Sh - 1,50 Sh = 0,085 Sh`.'

  notes:
  - Usually, messages can be represented with fewer characters by using suitable codes;
    the redundancy can be considered as a measure of the decrease of the average length
    of the messages accomplished by appropriate coding.
