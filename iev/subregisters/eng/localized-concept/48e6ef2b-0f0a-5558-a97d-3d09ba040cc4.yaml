  definition: logarithm of the ratio of a given time integral of squared A-frequency
    weighted sound pressure, over a stated time interval or event such as an aircraft
    flyover, to the product of the squared reference sound pressure of 20 Î¼Pa and
    the reference duration of one second. Sound exposure level in decibels is ten
    times the logarithm to the base ten of that ratio. The reference sound pressure
    and the frequency weighting may be different, if specifically stated with the
    sound exposure level
