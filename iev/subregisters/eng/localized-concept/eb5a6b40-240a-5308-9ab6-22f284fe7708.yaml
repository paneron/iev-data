  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the flow of a fluid in a given
    configuration characterized by a specified length `l`, defined by `R ​ e = ((rho
    v l))/(eta) = ((v l))/(nu)`, where the fluid is described by its mass density
    `ρ`, speed `v`, dynamic viscosity `η`, and kinematic viscosity `ν`

  notes:
  - 1 The Reynolds number characterizes the relative importance of inertia and viscosity
    in a fluid flow.
  - 2 When the Reynolds number is less than a critical value `Re`~crit~, laminar flow
    is stable. For higher values of `Re`, laminar flow becomes unstable. The critical
    value depends on the configuration.
  - 3 In case of a fluid flowing through a circular tube with diameter `d`, the specified
    length is `l` = `d`, and the critical value of the Reynolds number is `Re`~crit~
    ≈ 2 300.
