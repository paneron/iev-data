  notes:
  - 'The electric potential difference `V`~b~ âˆ’ `V`~a~ between two points a and b
    is equal to the negative of the line integral, along any path linking points a
    and b, of the irrotational vector `( E + ((del A))/((del t)) )`, where `*E*` is
    the electric field strength, `*A*` a magnetic vector potential and `t` the time:


    `V_b - V_a = - int_((r_a))^((r_b)) ( E + ((del A))/((del t)) ) * d r`


    where `*r*`~a~ and `*r*`~b~ are the position vectors for a and b, respectively,
    and d`*r*` is the vector line element.'
