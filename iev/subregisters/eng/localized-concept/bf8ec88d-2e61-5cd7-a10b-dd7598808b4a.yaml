  notes:
  - 'If `t`~`ij`~ is the duration of the `i`th interruption of supply to customer
    `j` during a time interval of duration `T`, and `N`~S~ the total number of customers
    served, then the service unavailability per customer served is given by


    `U_((CS)) = ((sum_i sum_j t_((i j))))/((N_S T))`'
  - Only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - If the duration of the time interval is expressed in years, the quantity is called
    the "average yearly downtime per customer served".
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Service unavailability per customer served can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
