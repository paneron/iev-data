    generated by equiangular spirals having a common axis and the same defining parameter

  notes:
  - The antenna usually has two arms fed by a balanced feedline. It may have multiple
    pairs of arms. A common design requires two pairs oriented 90Â° apart about their
    common axis and fed in phase quadrature.
  - The arms of the spirals can conform to planar or conical surfaces, in which case
    they are referred to as planar or conical equiangular spiral antennas respectively.
  - These antennas are usually designed so that the non-conducting portion of the
    surface to which the antenna conforms is of the same shape and size as the spiral
    arms. This design is said to be self-complementary.
