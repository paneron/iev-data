  definition: of a charged particle in a medium; the quotient of d`E` by d`l` where
    d`l` is the distance traversed by a particle and d`E` is the energy loss due to
    collisions with energy transfer less than a specified value `Δ` usually expressed
    in electron volts `L_(Delta) = (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_(Delta)`

  notes:
  - 'Although the definition specifies an energy cutoff and not a range cutoff the
    energy losses are sometimes called "energy locally imparted".


    Examples: `L`~100~ means linear energy transfer for collisions with energy transfers
    less than 100 eV; `L`~∞~ means linear energy transfer when all possible energy
    transfers are included.


    `L`~∞~ = `S`~col~'
