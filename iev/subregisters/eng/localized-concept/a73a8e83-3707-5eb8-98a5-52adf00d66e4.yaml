  definition: function representing the relative spectral sensitivity of the human
    eye to blue light hazards, based upon the relative spectral effectiveness of <a
    href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> to induce retinal photochemical injury
    (e.g. photic maculopathy)

  notes:
  - The wavelength range for the blue light hazard spectral weighting function is
    specified in ICNIRP-recommendations as `λ` = 300 nm to `λ` = 700 nm.
  - The blue light hazard spectral weighting function has unit one.
