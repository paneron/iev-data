  notes:
  - Recurrence periods of `T` = 50 years and `T` = 1 year and averaging times of `t`
    = 3 s and `t` = 10 min are used in a number of standards. In popular language
    the less precise term “survival wind speed” is often used. In practice, however,
    the wind turbine generator system is designed using the extreme wind speed for
    design load cases.
