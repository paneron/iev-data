  definition: for a photon emitter, the product of the exposure rate `overset(˙)(X)`,
    at a given distance `l` from a point radiation source of that emitter and the
    square of that distance divided by the activity `A` of the radiation source neglecting
    attenuation `Gamma = overset(˙)(X) ( l^2 // A )`
