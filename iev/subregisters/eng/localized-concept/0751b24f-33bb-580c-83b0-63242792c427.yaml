  notes:
  - Tribology deals with friction and wear in the macroscopic world. On the other
    hand, when the dimensions of {{components, IEV:151-11-21}} such as those in {{micromachines,
    IEV:523-01-03}} become extremely small, surface force and viscous force become
    dominant instead of gravity and inertial force. According to Coulomb's law of
    friction, frictional force is proportional to the normal load. In the micromachine
    environment, because of the reaction between surface forces, a large frictional
    force occurs that would be inconceivable in an ordinary scale environment. Also,
    a very small quantity of abrasion that would not be a problem in an ordinary scale
    environment can fatally damage a micromachine. Microtribology research seeks to
    reduce frictional forces and to discover conditions that are free of friction,
    even on an atomic level. In this research, observation is made of phenomena that
    occur with friction surfaces or solid surfaces at a resolution from 0,1 nm to
    1 nm, and analysis of interaction on an atomic level is performed. These approaches
    are expected to be applied in solving problems in tribology for the ordinary scale
    environment as well as for the micromachine environment.
