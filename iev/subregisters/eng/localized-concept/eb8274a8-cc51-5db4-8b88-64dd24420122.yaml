        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  dateAmended: 2019-03-01
  definition: quotient of the number of specified {{data elements, IEV:171-02-01}}
    {{transferred, IEV:171-06-01}} in a time interval by the duration of this interval
  examples:
  - '{{Digit rate, IEV:702-05-23}}, `r`~d~ or `ν`~d~; transfer rate for bytes, `r`~B~,
    `r`~o~, `ν`~B~, or `ν`~o~; {{binary digit rate, IEV:704-16-07}} (or bit rate),
    `r`~b~, `r`~bit~, `ν`~b~, or `ν`~bit~.'
  id: 171-06-03
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The transfer rate is expressed in seconds to the power of minus one (s^−1^). In
    practice, it is expressed in digits per second, for example in bits per second
    (bit/s) or in bytes per second (B/s). These units can be combined with decimal
    multiple prefixes, for example kilobyte per second (kB/s).
