  notes:
  - The binary relation is true or false according to whether the pair belongs or
    not to a specified subset of the Cartesian product of the set by itself. There
    is a one-to-one correspondence between binary relations in a set and the subsets
    of this Cartesian product.
  - A binary relation between elements `a` and `b` is denoted by `aâ„›b`.
