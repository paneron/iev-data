  notes:
  - The psophometer incorporates a weighting network, the characteristics of which
    differ according to the circuit under consideration, commercial telephone or sound
    program  transmission circuits. The psophometric weights correspond to the aural
    effect of disturbing voltages of various frequencies. The psophometer recommended
    by the CCITT is defined in the CCITT Recommendation 0.41 from the Fascicle IV-4
    of the Blue Book, 1989, for telephony, in the CCITT Recommendation J.16 from the
    fascicule III.6 of the Blue Book, 1989, for sound program channels.
