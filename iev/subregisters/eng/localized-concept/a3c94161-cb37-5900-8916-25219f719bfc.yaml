  definition: density of a radiant or luminous or photon quantity, `X`(`λ`), with
    respect to wavelength, `λ`, at the wavelength `λ` `X_(lambda) = ((d X ( lambda
    )))/((d lambda))`

  notes:
  - The term "spectral distribution" is to be preferred to the equivalent term "spectral
    concentration" when dealing with the function `Xλ`(`λ`) over a range of wavelengths,
    not at a particular wavelength.
  - Usually `Xλ` is also a function of `λ` and in this case, in order to stress this,
    can be written `Xλ`(`λ`) without any change of meaning.
  - The spectral distribution of radiant flux is expressed in watt per nanometre (W·nm^−1^),
    the spectral distribution of luminous flux is expressed in lumen per nanometre
    (lm·nm^−1^), the spectral distribution of photon flux is expressed in nanometre
    to the power minus one (nm^−1^). The units of spectral distributions of other
    quantities are expressed accordingly.
  - The quantity `X` can also be expressed as a function of {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}},
    `ν`, <a href="IEV845-21-026">wavenumber</a>, `σ`, etc.; the corresponding symbols
    are `X`(`ν`), `X`(`σ`), etc. and the corresponding densities with respect to frequency,
    `ν`, wavenumber, `σ`, etc. are `Xν`, `Xσ`, etc., in which case the expression
    of units will also change accordingly.
