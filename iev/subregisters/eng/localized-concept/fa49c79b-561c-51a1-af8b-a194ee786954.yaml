  notes:
  - In the ion-sensitive electrode section, the membrane voltage changes according
    to fluctuations in pH or carbon dioxide partial pressure in the blood, for example.
    As the voltage amplifier, the ISFET uses a FET, a transistor controlling the conductance
    of the current path (channels) formed by the majority carriers using an {{electric
    field, IEV:121-11-67}} perpendicular to the carrier flow. The ISFET is based on
    silicon micromachining technology integrating a detector and amplifier on a silicon
    {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}}. In addition, an ISFET with mechanical {{components,
    IEV:151-11-21}}  such as a valve has been developed. The ISFET is used in such
    fields as medical analysis and environmental instrumentation.
