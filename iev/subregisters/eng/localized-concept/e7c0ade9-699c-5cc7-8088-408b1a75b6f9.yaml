  definition: greatest distance between two points on a specified axis perpendicular
    to the beam axis, where the pulse-pressure-squared integral falls below its maximum
    on the specified axis by a specified amount

  notes:
  - Commonly used beamwidths are specified at –6 dB, –10 dB and –20 dB levels below
    the maximum. The decibel calculation implies taking 10 times the logarithm (to
    the base 10) of the ratios of the integrals.
