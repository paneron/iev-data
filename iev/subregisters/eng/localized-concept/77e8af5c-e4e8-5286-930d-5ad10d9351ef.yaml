  notes:
  - Daylight fluorescent colours absorb energy from daylight in the shorter wavelength
    regions of the visible spectrum and/or in the ultraviolet region and re-radiate
    some of this energy at longer wavelengths, producing radiation in a small range
    of wavelengths in the visible region.
