        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified

  definition: ratio of the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} `H` to the {{decision content,
    IEV:171-07-10}} `H`~0~ `H`~r~ = `H`/`H`~0~
  examples:
  - 'Let `{ a , b , c }` be a set of three events and let `p ( a ) = 0,5`, `p ( b
    ) = 0,25` and `p ( c ) = 0,25` be the probabilities of their occurrences. The
    relative entropy of this set is: `H_r = 1,5 Sh // 1,585 Sh tildetilde 0,95`.'
