  - The word "articulation" is used when the units of speech material are meaningless
    syllables or fragments; the word "intelligibility' is used when the units of speech
    material are complete, meaningful words, phrases or sentences.
  - 'It is important to specify the type of speech material: phonemes, logatomes,
    syllables, words, sentences, etc. The kind of speech material used is identified
    by an appropriate adjective syllable articulation, vowel (or consonant) articulation,
    monosyllabic word intelligibility, discrete word intelligibility, sentence intelligibility.'
