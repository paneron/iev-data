  definition: effective irradiance with the spectral irradiance, `Eλ`, spectrally
    weighted with the erythema spectral weighting function, `s`~er~(`λ`), normalized
    to 1 at its maximum

  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - The erythemal irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
