  definition: quotient step response Δ`v`~ε~(`t`) divided by the step height `K`~ε~
    of the step function, the quotient described by `h ( t ) = (1)/((K_(epsilon)))
    . Delta v_(epsilon) ( t )`

  notes:
  - 'The unit-step response may be calculated from the unit-impulse response by


    `h ( t ) = int_((- oo))^t g ( tau ) d tau`.'
  - The unit-step response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit step to an input variable.
