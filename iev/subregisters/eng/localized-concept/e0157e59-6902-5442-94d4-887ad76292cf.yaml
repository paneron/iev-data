      relationship:
        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  classification: Preferred

  definition: mean value of the {{conditional information content, IEV:171-07-21}}
    of the events in a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events,
    given the occurrence of the events in another set of mutually exclusive and jointly
    exhaustive events `H ( X | Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p ( x_i , y_j
    ) * I ( x_i | y_j )` where `X = { x_1 , ... , x_n }` is the set of events `x_i
    ( i = 1, ... , n )`, `Y = { y_1 , ... , y_m }` is the set of events `y_j ( j =
    1, ... , m )`, `I ( x_i | y_j )` is the conditional information content of `x_i`
    given `y_j`, and `p ( x_i , y_j )` the joint probability that both events occur
