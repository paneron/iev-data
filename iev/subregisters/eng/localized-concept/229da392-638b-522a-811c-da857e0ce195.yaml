  definition: one of a set of linearly independent vectors, the sum of which is equal
    to a given vector
  examples:
  - '* for a given vector `U = U_1 a_1 + U_2 a_2 + ... + U_n a_n`, where `U_1 , U_2
    , ... , U_n` are the coordinates of *`U`* and `a_1 , a_2 , ... , a_n` are the
    base vectors, any of the vectors `U_1 a_1 , U_2 a_2 , ... , U_n a_n`,


    * the projections of a vector normal and tangential to a surface (normal component
    and tangential component).'

  notes:
  - In English, the term "component vector" may be used if "component" is used in
    the sense of "coordinate" (see Note 2 to entry in {{IEV 102-03-09, IEV:102-03-09}}).
