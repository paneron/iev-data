  definition: a conventional value of apparent power, establishing a basis for the
    design of a transformer, a shunt reactor or an arc-suppression coil, the manufacturer's
    guarantees and the tests, determining a value of the rated current that may be
    carried with rated voltage applied, under specified conditions

  notes:
  - Both windings of a two-winding transformer have the same rated power, which by
    definition is the rated power of the transformer. For multi-winding transformers
    the rated power for each of the windings may differ.
