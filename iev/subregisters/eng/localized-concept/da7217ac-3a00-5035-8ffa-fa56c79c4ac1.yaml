  notes:
  - 'The SI unit of angle is the radian (symbol rad). Other units are the degree (symbol
    °), the minute (symbol ′) and the second (symbol ″): 1° = (π/180) rad, 1′ = (1/60)°,
    1″ = (1/60)′.'
  - The term "plane angle" is only used in place of the term "angle" to distinguish
    it from the term "{{solid angle, IEV:102-04-46}}".
  - The angle between a straight line and a plane and the angle between two planes
    are defined in {{IEV 102-04-56, IEV:102-04-56}} and {{IEV 102-04-57, IEV:102-04-57}},
    respectively.
