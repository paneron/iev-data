  notes:
  - 'The AC magnetization, `M(t),` under the magnetic field strength of `h_0 cos omega
    t` is expanded as:


    `M ( t ) = h_0 sum_((n = 0))^(oo) kappa_n^'' cos ( n omega t ) + kappa_n^″ sin
    ( n omega t )`


    where `kappa_n^''` and `kappa_n^″` are the real and imaginary parts of the AC
    magnetic susceptibility for the order `n`.'
  - The fundamental components `kappa_1^'` and `kappa_1^″` are mostly observed for
    measurements of superconducting transition.
  - 'The AC loss energy density `W` is given as:


    `W = pi mu_0 h_0^2 kappa_1^″`'
