  definition: 'the relative permeability obtained from the total change in magnetic
    flux density and the corresponding change in the magnetic field strength when
    either quantity is alternating with an arbitrary waveform between stated limits:
    `mu_p = (1)/((mu_0)) ((Delta B))/((Delta H))`'

  notes:
  - The value of the pulse permeability depends strongly on the limits of the flux
    density or field strength excursions; these limits need not be symmetrical with
    respect to zero.
  - Often pulse permeability refers to the special case of rectangular voltage pulses
    being applied to an exciting winding, the flux density waveform is then approximately
    triangular provided saturation is not approached.
