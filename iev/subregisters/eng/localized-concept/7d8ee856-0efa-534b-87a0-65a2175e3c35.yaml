  notes:
  - A detailed method of measurement is given in CIE 127, _Measurement of LEDs_.
  - Partial LED flux is a quantity that applies to a single LED only and should not
    be confused with the term "<a href="IEV845-21-110">partial luminous flux</a>".
  - The partial LED flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
