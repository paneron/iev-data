  definition: the velocity vector, at a point in a propagation medium, of a signal
    which may be ideally represented by two superimposed sinusoidal waves of equal
    amplitude and slightly different frequencies approaching a common frequency limit

  notes:
  - In the most general case, the magnitude of the group velocity vector equals the
    derivative of the frequency with respect to the reciprocal of the wavelength,
    and the components of the group velocity along the coordinate axes equal the partial
    derivatives of the angular frequency with respect to the components of the real
    part `vec K^( ' )` of the wave vector `vec underset(_)(K)`.
