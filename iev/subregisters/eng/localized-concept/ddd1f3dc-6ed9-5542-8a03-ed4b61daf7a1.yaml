  definition: '{{frequency band, IEV:103-09-01}} occupied by one {{signal, IEV:701-01-02}}
    or by a number of multiplexed signals at specified input and output points of
    a {{transmission system, IEV:704-04-19}}'

  notes:
  - In radiocommunication, the baseband is that frequency band occupied by the signal
    modulating the {{radio transmitter, IEV:713-08-01}}.
  - When the transmission involves {{multiple modulation, IEV:702-06-07}}, it is generally
    considered that the baseband is that frequency band occupied by the signal which
    is applied to the first modulation stage, and not the frequency band occupied
    by an intermediate modulated signal.
