  definition: microscope that uses a {{probe, IEV:313-09-11}} with a tip of atomic
    scale and scans it in a {{raster, IEV:531-14-20}} pattern close to the specimen
    for measuring physical quantities between the probe and the surface to obtain
    an image

  notes:
  - By approaching a sharply pointed probe tip to the surface of the specimen, various
    physical forces that work between the probe and the specimen can be measured at
    the resolution of an atomic scale. In general, the probe is moved over the surface
    of the specimen in a raster pattern while maintaining the measured physical quantity
    at a constant value, and the {{displacement, IEV:113-01-29}} of the probe in so
    doing is used as the data for drawing a fine image of the specimen. This is the
    common principle of different types of scanning probe microscope, i.e. the scanning
    tunnel microscope, {{atomic force microscope, IEV:523-07-02}}, electrostatic force
    microscope, scanning ion microscope, scanning magnetic field microscope, scanning
    temperature microscope, and scanning friction force microscope.
