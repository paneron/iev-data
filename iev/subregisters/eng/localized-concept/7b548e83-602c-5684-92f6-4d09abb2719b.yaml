  definition: phase angle as a function of the angular frequency `ω`
  examples: []
  id: 351-45-46
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - In graphical representation the phase angle is usually plotted versus the logarithmically
    represented value of the angular frequency `ω` (see Figure 10).
  - The phase response is the argument of the frequency response.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-38 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
