  definition: vector *`k`* in the expression `omega t - k * r + vartheta_0` of the
    phase of a sinusoidal wave
  examples: []
  id: 103-10-09
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The wave vector is normal to the wave front and its magnitude is the angular wavenumber.
  - This concept can be generalized to complex wave vector in order to take attenuation
    in account (see IEC 60050-705).
