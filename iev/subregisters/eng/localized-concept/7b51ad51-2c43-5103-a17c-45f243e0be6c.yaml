  notes:
  - The conjugate of the complex number `c = a + j b = | c | e^(j phi)` is `c * =
    a - j b = | c | e^(- j phi)`. In mathematics, the conjugate of `c` is often denoted
    by `bar c`.
  - The concept of conjugate may be applied to complex scalar, vector or tensor quantities
    or to matrices of complex elements.
