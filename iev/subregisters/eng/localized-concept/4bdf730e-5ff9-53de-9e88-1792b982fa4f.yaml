  definition: quotient of d`N` by d`a` and by d`t`, where d`N` is the increment of
    the number of particles incident on a cross-sectional area d`a` in the time interval
    d`t` `N`^0^ = d^2^`N`/d`a` d`t`

  notes:
  - Generally the term neutron (or other particle) flux is used.
  - This quantity is expressed in reciprocal seconds per unit area (m^−2^ s^−1^ or
    cm^−2^ s^−1^).
