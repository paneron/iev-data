    IEV:112-01-13}}. Examples: transfer ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, transformation
    ratio.'
  - The ratio `a // b` is expressed by the words “ratio of `a` to `b`”.
  - 'For the ratio of two quantities, the term “index” is sometimes used in place
    of ratio. Examples: refractive index, loss index.'
