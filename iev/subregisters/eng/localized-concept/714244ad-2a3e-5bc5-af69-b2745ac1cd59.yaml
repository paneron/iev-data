  notes:
  - This definition is independent from the existence of enclosure(s) and of terminals.
  - The output of an LED is a function of its physical construction, the material
    from which the LED is constructed and the exciting current. The optical emission
    can be in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared wavelength regions.
  - The term "LED" represents the LED die (or chip), or LED package. It is also used
    as part of a compound term, e.g. "LED technology", "LED television".
  - The term "LED" shall not be used as an adjective for reporting product performance
    as for example "LED luminous flux", "LED colour rendering" or "LED lifetime".
    Instead, use for example "luminous flux of the LED package", "colour rendering
    of the LED module" or "lifetime of the LED lamp".
