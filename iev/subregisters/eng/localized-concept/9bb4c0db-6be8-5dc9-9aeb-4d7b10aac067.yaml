  definition: real or virtual object that forms the smallest possible retinal image
    (considering the accommodation range of the human eye) for a given evaluation
    location of the retinal hazard

  notes:
  - The accommodation range of the eye is assumed to be variable from 100 mm to infinity.
    The location of the apparent source for a given viewing position in the beam is
    that location to which the eye accommodates to produce the most hazardous retinal
    irradiance condition.
  - This definition is used to determine, for a given evaluation position, the location
    of the apparent origin of laser radiation in the wavelength range of 380 nm to
    1 400 nm. In the limit of vanishing divergence, i.e. in the case of a well-collimated
    beam, the location of the apparent source goes to infinity.
