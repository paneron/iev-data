  definition: density of radiant intensity with respect to projected area in a specified
    direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface `L_e = ((d I_e))/((d
    A)) (1)/((cos alpha))` where `I`~e~ is radiant intensity, `A` is area, and `α`
    is the angle between the normal to the surface at the specified point and the
    specified direction

  notes:
  - 'In a practical sense, the definition of radiance can be thought of as dividing
    a real or imaginary surface into an infinite number of infinitesimally small surfaces
    which can be considered as <a href="IEV845-21-033"> point sources</a>, each of
    which has a specific radiant intensity, `I`~e~, in the specified direction. The
    radiance of the surface is then the integral of these radiance elements over the
    whole surface.


    The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative
    (i.e. a rate of change of radiant intensity with projected area) and could alternatively
    be rewritten in terms of the average radiant intensity, `bar I_e`, as:


    `L_e = underset((A -&gt; 0))((lim)) ((bar I_e))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))`.


    Hence, radiance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities; the
    area, `A`, should be small enough so that uncertainties due to variations in radiant
    intensity within that area are negligible; otherwise, the quotient `bar L_e =
    ((bar I_e))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))` gives the average radiance and the specific
    measurement conditions have to be reported with the result.'
  - For a surface being irradiated, an equivalent formula in terms of irradiance,
    `E`~e~, and solid angle, `Ω`, is `L_e = ((d E_e))/((d omega)) (1)/((cos theta))`,
    where `θ` is the angle between the normal to the surface being irradiated and
    the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source has no surface
    (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).
  - An equivalent formula is `L_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d G))`, where `Φ`~e~ is radiant
    flux and `G` is geometric extent.
  - 'Radiant flux can be obtained by integrating radiance over projected area, `A`·cos
    `α`, and solid angle, `Ω`: `Phi_e = ​ ∬ L_e * cos alpha d A d omega`.'
  - Since the <a href="IEV845-21-048">optical extent</a>, expressed by `G·n`^2^, where
    `G` is geometric extent and `n` is refractive index, is invariant, the quantity
    expressed by `L`~e~`·n`^−2^ is also invariant along the path of the beam if the
    losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken as 0. That quantity is
    called "basic radiance".
  - 'The equation in the definition can also be described as a function of radiant
    flux, `Φ`~e~. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second partial
    derivative of the radiant flux at a specified point (`x`, `y`) in space in a specified
    direction (`ϑ`, `φ`) with respect to projected area, `A`·cos `α`, and solid angle,
    `Ω`:


    `L_e ( x , y , vartheta , phi ) = ((del^2 Phi_e ( x , y , vartheta , phi )))/((del
    A ( x , y ) * cos alpha * del omega ( vartheta , phi )))`


    where `α` is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point
    and the specified direction.'
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon radiance".
  - The radiance is expressed in watt per square metre per steradian (W·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
