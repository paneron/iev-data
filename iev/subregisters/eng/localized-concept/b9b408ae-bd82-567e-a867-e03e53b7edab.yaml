  definition: 'for a regular square matrix *`A`*, square matrix *`A`*^−1^ such that:
    *`AA`*^−1^ = *`A`*^−1^*`A`* = *`E`*, where *`E`* is the unit matrix'

  notes:
  - The inverse of a square matrix *`A`* = (`Aij`) is denoted by *`A`*^−1^ = (`Aij`)^−1^,
    with elements denoted by (*`A`*^−1^)~`ij`~. The notation (`Aij`^−1^) must not
    be used because it means the matrix constructed from inverse elements of *`A`*.
