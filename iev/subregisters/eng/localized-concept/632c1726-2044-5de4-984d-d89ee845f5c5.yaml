  notes:
  - 'The signalling rate is given by


    `sum_((i = 1))^((i = m)) (1)/((T_i)) (log)_2 n_i`


    where `m` is the number of parallel transmission channels, `Ð¢`~`i`~ is the shortest
    theoretical duration of signal element for the `i`-th channel expressed in seconds,
    and `n`~`i`~ is the number of significant conditions of the modulation in the
    `i`-th channel.'
  - The symbol of the unit of binary rate is bit/s.
