  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the electromagnetic field
    at a given point, to the field at another point on the same vertical line at a
    reference height

  notes:
  - The height gain when expressed in decibels may have a negative value.
  - In the case of spherical diffraction by the Earth, the reference height generally
    used depends on the wavelength and on the ratio of the effective radius of the
    Earth to the actual Earth radius.
