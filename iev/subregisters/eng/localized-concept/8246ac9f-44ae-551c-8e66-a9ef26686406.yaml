  notes:
  - Perceived colour depends on the spectral distribution of the colour stimulus,
    on the size, shape, structure and surround of the stimulus area, on the state
    of adaptation of the observer's visual system, and on the observer's experience
    of the prevailing and similar situations of observation.
  - Perceived colour can appear in several modes of colour appearance. The names for
    various modes of appearance are intended to distinguish among qualitative and
    geometric differences of colour perceptions. Some of the more important terms
    of the modes of colour appearance are given in "object colour", "surface colour"
    and "aperture colour". Other modes of colour appearance include film colour, volume
    colour, illuminant colour, body colour, and Ganzfeld colour. Each of these modes
    of colour appearance can be further qualified by adjectives to describe combinations
    of colour or their spatial and temporal relationships. Other terms that relate
    to qualitative differences among colours perceived in various modes of colour
    appearance are given in "luminous colour", "non-luminous colour", "related colour"
    and "unrelated colour".
