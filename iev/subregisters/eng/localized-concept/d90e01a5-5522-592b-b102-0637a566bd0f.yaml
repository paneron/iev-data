  definition: for a parallel beam of specified radiation in a given substance, the
    quantity `μ`~abs~ describes the fraction of energy absorbed in passing through
    a thin layer of thickness Δ`x`

  notes:
  - The absorption coefficient is primarily energy dependent.
  - According to whether the thickness Δ`x` is expressed in terms of length, mass
    per unit area, moles per unit area or atoms per unit area, it is called the linear,
    mass, molar or atomic absorption coefficient.
