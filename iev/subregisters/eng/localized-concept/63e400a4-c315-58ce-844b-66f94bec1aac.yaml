  definition: system for determining the <a href="IEV845-23-038">tristimulus values</a>
    of any spectral power distribution using the set of reference colour stimuli &amp;lsqb;X&amp;rsqb;,
    &amp;lsqb;Y&amp;rsqb;, &amp;lsqb;Z&amp;rsqb; and the three CIE colour-matching
    functions `bar x ( lambda ) , bar y ( lambda ) , bar z ( lambda )` adopted by
    the CIE in 1931

  notes:
  - '`bar y ( lambda )` is identical to `V`(`λ`) and hence the tristimulus values
    `Y` are proportional to values of luminance.'
  - The CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system is applicable to centrally viewed fields
    of angular subtense between about 1° and about 4° (0,017 rad and 0,07 rad).
  - The CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system can be derived from the CIE 1931 RGB
    colorimetric system using a transformation based on a set of three linear equations.
    The CIE 1931 RGB system is based on three real monochromatic reference stimuli.
  - See also CIE 15, `Colorimetry`.
  - This entry was numbered 845-03-28 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
