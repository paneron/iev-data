  definition: 'the quotient of d`E`~rad~ by the product of `ρ` and d`l`, where d`E`~rad~
    is the energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy by radiation in traversing
    a path length d`l` in a material of density `ρ`: `((S_((rad))))/(rho) = (1)/(rho)
    (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_((rad))`'
