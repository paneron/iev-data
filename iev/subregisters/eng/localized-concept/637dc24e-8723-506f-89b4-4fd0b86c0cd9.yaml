  notes:
  - In practice, any variations of the time intervals are constrained within specified
    limits.
  - Two phenomena, time-scales, or signals may be synchronous without being isochronous.
  - For periodic phenomena, time-scales or signals, the corresponding significant
    instants occur at the same average rate.
