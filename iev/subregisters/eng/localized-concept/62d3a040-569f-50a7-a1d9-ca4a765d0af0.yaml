  notes:
  - Fluorescence is understood to include both fluorescent and phosphorescent phenomena
    with time constants short enough to be ignored for the application.
  - 'The relative spectral fluorescence distribution, `F`(`λ`), when multiplied by
    the spectral external radiant efficiency of the fluorescent specimen, `Q`, for
    excitation at wavelength, `μ`, gives the bispectral luminescent radiance factor,
    `β`~L,~`λ`(`μ`), of a <a href="IEV845-24-040">photoluminescent material</a> according
    to:


    `β`~L,~`λ`(`μ`) = `F`(`λ`)·`Q`(`μ`)'
  - The relative spectral fluorescence distribution has unit one.
