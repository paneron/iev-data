  definition: 'vector quantity obtained at a given point by subtracting the magnetization
    `*M*` from the magnetic flux density `*B*` divided by the magnetic constant `μ`~0~:
    `H = (B)/((mu_0)) - M`'

  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the magnetic field strength is at all points equal to the magnetic
    flux density divided by the magnetic constant:


    `H = (B)/((mu_0))`'
  - 'The rotation of the magnetic field strength is the total current density *`J`*~t~:


    *rot `H`* = *`J`*~t~'
  - The magnetic flux density `*B*` is sometimes called “magnetic field”, risking
    confusion with the magnetic field strength `*H*`.
