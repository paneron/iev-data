  definition: 'element of a set containing the real numbers and other elements, which
    may be represented by an ordered pair of real numbers (`a`, `b`), with following
    properties: * the pair (`a`, 0) represents the real number `a`, * an addition
    is defined by `( a_1 , b_1 ) + ( a_2 , b_2 ) = ( a_1 + a_2 , b_1 + b_2 )`, * a
    multiplication is defined by `( a_1 , b_1 ) xx ( a_2 , b_2 ) = ( a_1 a_2 - b_1
    b_2 , a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 )`'

  notes:
  - All properties of real numbers (operations and limits) are extended to complex
    numbers except the order relation.
  - The complex number defined by the pair (`a`, `b`) is denoted by `c = a + j b`
    where j is the imaginary unit ({{IEV 102-02-10, IEV:102-02-10}}) represented by
    the pair (0, 1), `a` is the real part and `b` the imaginary part. A complex number
    may also be expressed as `c = | c | ( cos phi + j sin phi ) = | c | e^(j phi)`
    where `| c |` is a non-negative real number called modulus and `φ` a real number
    called argument.
  - In electrotechnology, a complex number is usually denoted by an underlined letter
    symbol, for example `underset(_)(c)`.
  - The set of complex numbers is denoted by ℂ (C with a vertical bar in the left
    arc) or *C*. This set without zero is denoted by an asterisk to the symbol, for
    example ℂ*.
