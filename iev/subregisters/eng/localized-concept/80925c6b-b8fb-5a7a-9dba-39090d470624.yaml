  definition: length describing the spatial variation of the order parameter in the
    Ginzburg-Landau theory

  notes:
  - '`ξ` called the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length is a function of temperature
    and nearly equal to the BCS coherence length, `ξ`~0~, at 0 K in a clean superconductor
    ({{815-10-35, IEV:815-10-35}}).'
  - '`ξ` = (`Φ`~0~/2π`μ`~0~`H`~c2~)^1/2^, where `Φ`~0~ is the flux quantum, `μ`~0~
    is the magnetic constant and `H`~c2~ is the upper critical field strength.'
