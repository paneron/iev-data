  definition: 'for a sinusoidal wave of angular frequency `Ï‰`, the vector product:
    `(1)/(2) vec underset(_)(E) xx vec underset(_)(H)^( ** )` when the electric field
    vector `vec E ( t )` and the magnetic field vector `vec H ( t )` are represented
    at the same point, in complex notation, by the equations: `vec E ( t ) = Re (
    underset(_)((vec E)) e^(j omega t) )` `vec H ( t ) = Re ( underset(_)((vec H))
    e^(j omega t) )` where `vec underset(_)(E)` and `vec underset(_)(H)` are not time-dependent
    and are generally complex, `vec underset(_)(H)^( ** )` being the complex conjugate
    of `vec underset(_)(H)`'

  notes:
  - The real part of the complex Poynting vector is the average of the Poynting vector
    during one cycle.
  - The imaginary part of the complex Poynting vector is a vector of which, with certain
    reservations, the direction may be considered as being that of reactive energy
    propagation, and the magnitude may be regarded as the reactive power flux per
    unit surface area perpendicular to this direction, with a sign assigned conventionally.
