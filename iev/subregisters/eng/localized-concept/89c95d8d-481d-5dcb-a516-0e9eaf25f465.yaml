  definition: '{{multiplexing, IEV:701-03-09}} in which several independent {{signals,
    IEV:701-01-02}} are allotted separate wavelengths for {{transmission, IEV:701-01-03}}

  notes:
  - Wavelength division multiplexing is a form of {{frequency division multiplexing,
    IEV:704-08-05}}. The use of the distinct term "wavelength division multiplexing"
    allows this concept to be distinguished from that in which frequency division
    multiplexing is used in assembling the {{baseband, IEV:702-01-06}} signal that
    has to be carried over the optical link at one {{wavelength, IEV:103-10-10}}.
