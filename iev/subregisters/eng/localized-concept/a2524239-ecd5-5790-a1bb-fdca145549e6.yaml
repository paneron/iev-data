  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The impedance can be expressed in terms of admittance.
  - In certain instances, for example, sampling devices or self-balancing potentiometers,
    the impedance can be different according to the instant when it is determined,
    before, during or after the instant of measurement.
  - When the output circuit is such that the instantaneous value of the current flowing
    into the output terminals is a non-linear function of the instantaneous value
    of the output voltage under specified conditions of frequency and voltage, the
    combination of resistance and reactance which would absorb the same active power
    and in which would flow a reactive current equal to the fundamental component
    that is flowing in the actual output circuit, is sometimes called the "equivalent
    output impedance".
