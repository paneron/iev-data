  definition: ratio of the absolute value of the mutual permeance `Λij` related to
    two circuit elements `i` and `j` to the geometric average of their self-permeances
    `Λii` and `Λjj` `k_((i j)) = ((| Lambda_(( i j)) |))/((sqrt(Lambda_(( i i)) Lambda_((j
    j)))))`

  notes:
  - 'The inductive coupling factor can also be expressed as


    `k_((i j)) = ((| L_(( i j)) |))/((sqrt(L_(( i i)) L_((j j)))))`


    where `Lii` and `Ljj` are the self-inductances of the elements and `Lij` their
    mutual inductance.'
