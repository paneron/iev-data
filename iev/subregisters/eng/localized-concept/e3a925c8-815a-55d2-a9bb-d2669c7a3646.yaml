  - "Widely accepted definitions include:\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n\
    \n* `C` = (`L`~1~ − `L`~2~)/`L`~1~ with `L`~1~ &gt; `L`~2~ (positive contrast),\n\
    \n* `C` = (`L`~1~ − `L`~2~)/`L`~1~ with `L`~1~ &lt; `L`~2~ (negative contrast),\
    \ \n\n* `C` = (`L`~1~ − `L`~2~)/(`L`~1~ + `L`~2~) with `L`~1~ &gt; `L`~2~, \n\n\
    \n\nwhere `C` is the luminance contrast and `L`~1~ and `L`~2~ are the luminances\
    \ of the two surfaces."
  - Although luminance contrast is intended to correlate with brightness contrast,
    it is possible that it does not do so directly because brightness contrast depends
    on other factors such as the angular separation, the luminance gradient, and any
    size difference between the two surfaces.
