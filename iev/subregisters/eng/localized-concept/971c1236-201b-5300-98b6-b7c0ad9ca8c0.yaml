  definition: array of `mn` scalars arranged in `m` rows and `n` columns
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The scalars in the array are called elements of the matrix.
  - The matrix notation is also used with scalar quantities instead of scalars, these
    quantities being not necessarily of the same kind. Examples are the impedance
    matrix and the `H`-matrix (see IEC 60027-2). A matrix notation is sometimes used
    for operators. This should be justified in each case.
  - 'A matrix is represented by a letter symbol in italic bold-face type or by the
    table of elements within parentheses: *`A`* or `( [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1 n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((m
    1)),cdots,A_((m n))]] )`. The notation (`Aij`) is also used, for example to distinguish
    the matrix *`A`* from a vector *`A`*. Square brackets are also used instead of
    parentheses. For a matrix *`A`*, the element at the row `i` and the column `j`
    may be denoted by (*`A`*)~ij~ or by `Aij` if there is no ambiguity.'
  - A matrix is complex if its elements are complex numbers or quantities. A complex
    matrix may be denoted by *`A`*, the elements by (*`A`*)~`ij`~ or (*`A`*)~`ij`~.
