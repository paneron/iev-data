  definition: quotient of the luminance of a surface element in a specified direction,
    `L`~v,n~, and the luminance of the perfect reflecting diffuser or perfect transmitting
    diffuser identically illuminated and viewed, `L`~v,d~ `beta_v = ((L_((v ,n))))/((L_((v
    ,d))))`

  notes:
  - The definition holds for a surface element of a non-luminous medium, in a given
    direction and under specified conditions of irradiation.
  - This quantity is also defined spectrally and is called "spectral luminance factor".
  - 'For photoluminescent media, the luminance factor consists of two components:
    the reflected luminance factor, `β`~v,R~, and the luminescent luminance factor,
    `β`~v,L~. The sum of the reflected and luminescent luminance factors is called
    "total luminance factor" and can be expressed by `β`~v,T~: `β`~v,T~ = `β`~v,R~ + `β`~v,L~.


    The subscript R is used here for the reflected luminance factor because it is
    more intuitive than the traditional S and avoids confusion with the use of S to
    denote a state of polarization.'
  - The luminance factor has unit one.
