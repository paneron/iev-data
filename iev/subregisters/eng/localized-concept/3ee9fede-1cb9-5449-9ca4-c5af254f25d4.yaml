  definition: in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, ordered set of three linearly
    independent vectors *`U`*, *`V`* and *`W`*, such that for an observer looking
    in the direction of *`W`*, the rotation through the smaller angle from *`U`* to
    *`V`* is observed to be in the clockwise sense

  notes:
  - 'The vectors of a right-handed trihedron are oriented: the thumb (*`U`*), the
    forefinger (*`V`*) and the middle finger (*`W`*) of the right hand, when the forefinger(*`V`*)
    is extended and the latter (*`W`*) is pointing at right angles to the others (*`U`*)
    and (*`V`*).'
