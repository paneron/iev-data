  notes:
  - A unilaterally aligned standard is not harmonized (or equivalent) with the standard
    with which it is aligned.
  - '{{Technical regulations, IEV:901-02-11}} can be harmonized like standards. Corresponding
    terms and definitions are obtained by replacing “standards” by “technical regulations”
    in the definitions {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}} to {{IEV 901-06-09, IEV:901-06-09}},
    and “standardizing bodies” by “authorities” in definition {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}}.'
