  definition: for a linear two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit, under sinusoidal
    conditions, quantity equal to the product of the apparent power `S` and the sine
    of the displacement angle `φ` `Q = S sin phi`

  notes:
  - The reactive power is the imaginary part of the complex power `underset(_)(S)`,
    thus `Q = Im underset(_)(S)`. Its absolute value is equal to the non-active power,
    thus `| Q | = Q_( ∼ )`.
  - The coherent SI unit for reactive power is voltampere, VA. The special name var
    and its symbol var are also used. See {{131-11-45, IEV:131-11-45}}.
