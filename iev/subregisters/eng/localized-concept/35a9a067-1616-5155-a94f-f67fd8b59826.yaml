  notes:
  - Other design related climatic parameters are derived from the reference wind speed
    and other basic class parameters
  - A turbine designed for a wind turbine class corresponding to a reference wind
    speed, is designed to withstand climates for which the extreme 10 min average
    wind speed with a recurrence period of 50 years at turbine hub height is lower
    than or equal to the reference wind speed.
