  definition: 'at a given point of a body, tensor quantity `vec vec tau` characterizing
    the relation between the force d*`F`* acting on a surface element containing that
    point with the area d`A` of the element: `d F = vec vec tau * e \ d A`, where
    *`e`* d`A` is the vector surface element'
  examples: []

  notes:
  - 1 If d*`F`* and *`e`* d`A` are parallel, stress may be described by a scalar.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of stress is pascal, Pa.
