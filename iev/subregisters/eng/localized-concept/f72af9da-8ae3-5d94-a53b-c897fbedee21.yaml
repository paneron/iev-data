  definition: under sinusoidal conditions in a medium where the phasors `B` and `H`
    representing respectively the magnetic flux density and the magnetic field strength
    are linearly related, complex quantity `μ`~r~ defined by the relation `B` = `μ`~0~`μ`~r~
    `H` where `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant

  notes:
  - The complex relative permeability is generally frequency dependent. For an isotropic
    medium the complex relative permeability is a scalar; for an anisotropic medium
    it is a tensor.
  - Generally `μ`~r~ is expressed as `μ`~r~ = `μ`'~r~ − j`μ`''~r~  where `μ`'~r~ is
    the real relative permeability and `μ`''~r~ is the magnetic loss index which represents
    the magnetic losses.
