    digital output levels for an opto-electronic digital image capture system

  notes:
  - If the input log exposure points are very finely spaced and the output noise is
    small compared to the quantization interval, the opto-electronic conversion function
    can have a step-like character. Such behaviour is an artefact of the quantization
    process and should be removed by using an appropriate smoothing algorithm or by
    fitting a smooth curve to the data.
