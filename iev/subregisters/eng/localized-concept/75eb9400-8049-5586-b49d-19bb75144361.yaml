  definition: 'at a given point within a surface element of quasi-infinitesimal area
    `S`, vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers confined to
    the surface element, of the products of electric charge and velocity, divided
    by the area `S`: `A = (1)/(S) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i` where `n` is the number
    of free carriers confined to the surface element, `Q`~`i`~ the electric charge
    of the `i`^th^ carrier and *`v`*~i~ its velocity'

  notes:
  - 'For charge carriers confined to a surface, the integral along a curve of this
    surface joining two points `a` and `b`, the differential element of which is the
    scalar product of the lineic electric current `*A*`  and the vector `*e*`~n~d`s`
    normal to the curve in a specified direction tangent to the surface and of magnitude
    equal to the scalar line element d`s`, is equal to the limit of the quotient of
    the electric charge `Q` transferred across the curve in the specified direction
    during a time interval by the duration `τ`  of this interval when `τ`  tends to
    zero:


    `int_((s_a))^((s_b)) A * e_n d s = underset((tau -&gt; 0))((lim)) (Q)/(tau)`


    where `s`~a~ and `s`~b~ are the path coordinates for `a` and `b`, respectively.'
