  definition: quotient of the radiant flux or luminous flux `Φ`~2~ (or `Φ`~1~) that
    surface S~1~ (or S~2~) sends to surface S~2~ (or S~1~) and the <a href="IEV845-21-080">radiant
    exitance</a> or <a href="IEV845-21-081">luminous exitance</a> `M`~1~ (or `M`~2~)
    `g = ((Phi_2))/((M_1)) = ((Phi_1))/((M_2))`

  notes:
  - 'Since `M` = π`L`, and in the particular case where all points on S~1~ are seen
    from all points on S~2~


    `g = (1)/(pi) underset((A_2))( int ) underset((A_1))( int ) ((cos theta_1 cos
    theta_2))/((l^2)) d A_1 d A_2 = (1)/(pi) G`


    where `l` is the distance between the elements of areas d`A`~1~ and d`A`~2~ on
    the surfaces S~1~ and S~2~, `G` is the geometric extent of the beam delimited
    by the boundaries of S~1~ and S~2~, and `θ`~1~ and `θ`~2~ are the angles between
    the surface normals of the two elementary areas d`A`~1~ and d`A`~2~ respectively
    and the line joining the two elementary areas.'
  - 'For two elementary areas dA~1~ and dA~2~


    `d g = (1)/(pi) d A_1 d omega_1 cos theta_1 = (1)/(pi) d A_2 d omega_2 cos theta_2`


    where d`Ω`~1~ (or d`Ω`~2~) is the solid angle which the area d`A`~2~ (or d`A`~1~)
    subtends from the centre of d`A`~1~ (or d`A`~2~).'
  - 'The radiance or luminance `L` of the beam delimited by the boundaries of dA~1~
    and dA~2~ is


    `L = (1)/(pi) ((d Phi))/((d g))`.'
  - The mutual exchange coefficient is expressed in square metre (m^2^).
