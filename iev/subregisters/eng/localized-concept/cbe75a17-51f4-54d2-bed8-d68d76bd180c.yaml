  notes:
  - The latching, and the release of the latching, may be mechanical, electromagnetic,
    pneumatic, etc.
  - Because of the latching, the latched contactor actually acquires a second position
    of rest and, according to the definition of a contactor it is not, strictly speaking,
    a contactor. However, since the latched contactor in both its utilization and
    its design is more closely related to contactors in general than to any other
    classification of switching device, it is considered proper to require that it
    complies with the specifications for contactors wherever they are appropriate.
