  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of the maximum possible magnitude
    `F`~t max~ of the friction force between two solid bodies with zero relative speed
    in the surface of contact, to the magnitude `F`~n~ of the normal force, thus `Î¼`~s~
    = `F`~t max~ / `F`~n~

  notes:
  - 1 The friction force is the tangential component and the normal force is the normal
    component of the contact force between two bodies at relative rest, so not yet
    sliding.
  - 2 The tangential force `F`~t max~ is greater than the tangential force `F`~t~
    for slow relative speed.
