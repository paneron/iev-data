  notes:
  - The components can be organic, inorganic or hybrid nanotechnology-based and function
    on the {{nanoscale, IEV:511-01-03}} for sensing, actuation, signal processing,
    display, or {{control, IEV:351-42-19}}.
  - The components can be micro- or nano-machined to produce free surfaces and volumes
    that will be able to couple with the environment so that a physical, optical,
    chemical, or biological phenomenon is transduced to an electric signal.
