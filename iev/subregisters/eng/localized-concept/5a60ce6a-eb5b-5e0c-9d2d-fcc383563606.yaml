  definition: 'the ratio `U`~d~/ `U`~N~ (tapping factor) or 100 `U`~d~/ `U`~N~ (tapping
    factor expressed as a percentage) where: `U`~N~ is the rated voltage of the winding
    `U`~d~ is the voltage which would be developed at no-load at the terminals of
    the winding, connected on the tapping concerned, by applying rated voltage to
    an untapped winding'

  notes:
  - The tapping factor expresses the relative value of the "effective number of turns"
    of the tapped winding at the relevant tapping, the basis 1 being the effective
    number of turns of this winding at the principal tapping.
