  definition: peak value of an impulse test voltage at which insulation at the {{work
    location, IEV:651-26-03}} exhibits, under specified conditions, a referenced value
    of probability of withstand

  notes:
  - The purpose is to reduce the risk of breakdown of the insulation to an acceptably
    low level. It is generally considered that an acceptable low level is reached
    when the value of the required insulation level is greater than or equal to the
    overvoltage which has a probability of being exceeded by no more than 2 %.
