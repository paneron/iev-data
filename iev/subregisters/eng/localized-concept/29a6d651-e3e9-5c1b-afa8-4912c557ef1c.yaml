  definition: time response of a linear time-invariant system, which initially is
    in steady state `U`~0~, `V`~0~, produced by application of an impulse function
    Δ`u`~δ~(`t`) = `K`~δ~·δ(`t`) to one of the input variables, where Δ`v`~δ~(`t`)
    = `v`(`t`) – `V`~0~ and Δ`u`~δ~(`t`) = `u`(`t`) – `U`~0~
