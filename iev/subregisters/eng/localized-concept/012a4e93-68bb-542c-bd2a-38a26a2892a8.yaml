  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian of a scalar field quantity
    is:


    `Delta f = ((del^2 f))/((del x^2)) + ((del^2 f))/((del y^2)) + ((del^2 f))/((del
    z^2))`.'
  - The Laplacian of the scalar field `f` is denoted Δ`f` or ∇^2^`f`, where Δ is the
    Laplacian operator.
