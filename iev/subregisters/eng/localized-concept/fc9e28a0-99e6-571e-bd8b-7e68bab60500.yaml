  notes:
  - The term "power" is also used for an expression representing an exponentiation.
  - In the power `a`^`b`^, `a` is the base and `b` is the exponent. The power is expressed
    by the words "`a` to the power `b`" or simply "`a` to `b`".
  - The power with exponent 2 is the square, `a^2 = a * a`, the power with exponent
    3 is the cube, `a^3 = a * a * a`, the power with exponent âˆ’1 is the inverse, `a^(-
    1) = 1 // a`, the power with exponent 1/2 is the square root, `a^(1 // 2) = sqrt(a)`.
