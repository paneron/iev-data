  notes:
  - For example, if the duration of the unit interval is 20 ms, the modulation rate
    is 50 Bd.
  - The term “rapidité de modulation” is used in French in all cases, with the synonym
    “débit en ligne” in the case of digital transmission; in English the terms “modulation
    rate” and “line digit rate” are used in different fields.
