  definition: tensor of the second order with components `T_((i j)) = delta_((i j))`
    where `delta_((i j))` is the Kronecker delta, equal to 1 if `i` = `j` and 0 if
    `i` â‰  `j`

  notes:
  - The components of the Kronecker tensor are independent of the base used. The inner
    product of the Kronecker tensor and a tensor or a vector is equal to this tensor
    or vector.
  - When the properties of an anisotropic medium are represented at each point by
    a tensor quantity of the second order, this quantity reduces, in an isotropic
    medium, to the product of the Kronecker tensor and a scalar quantity. In practice,
    the quantity is then considered as a scalar quantity.
