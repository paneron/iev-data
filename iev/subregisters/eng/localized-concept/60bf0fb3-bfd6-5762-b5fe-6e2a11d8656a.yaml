  definition: 'unique positive value, if it exists, associated with a subset of a
    surface in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, with the following properties:
    * for a rectangle, the value is the product of the two side lengths, * for a disjoint
    union of subsets, the value is the sum of the values associated with these subsets,
    * for more complicated subsets, the value can be approximated by sums and given
    by an integral'

  notes:
  - For the portion of plane limited by the straight lines `x` = `a`, `x` = `b`, `y`
    = 0 and the arc of curve `y = f`(`x`) with `a` &lt; `b` and `f`(`x`) ≥ 0, the
    area is `int_a^b f ( x ) d x`.
  - For a surface defined by `r = f ( u , v )` where `( u , v ) in U sube R^2`, the
    area is `underset(U)( ∬ ) | ((del f))/((del u)) * ((del f))/((del u)) | * d u
    d v`.
  - For a surface defined by the equation `z` = `f`(`x, y`), the area is `underset(S)(
    ∬ ) sqrt(1 + ( ((del f))/((del x)) )^2 + ( ((del f))/((del y)) )^2) d x d y`.
  - In the usual geometrical space, the area of a surface is a quantity of the dimension
    length squared.
