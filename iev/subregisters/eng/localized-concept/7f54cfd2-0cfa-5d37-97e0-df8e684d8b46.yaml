  notes:
  - The disappearance may be due to self-recovery.
  - In IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015), this concept
    was termed "intermittent fault", with "volatile fault" and "transient fault" as
    synonyms, but not all transient faults are intermittent faults ({{192-04-06, IEV:192-04-06}}).
  - IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015) identified
    “volatile fault” as a synonym, which is deprecated as it is not true in all applications.
