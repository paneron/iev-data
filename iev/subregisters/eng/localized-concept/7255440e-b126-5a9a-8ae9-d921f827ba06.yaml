  notes:
  - 'The angular precessional frequency `ω` of an electron is related to the applied
    magnetic field `H` by the expression: `ω` = `γ μ`~0~ `H`


    where `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant and `γ` is the gyromagnetic coefficient.'
  - 'For a free electron the gyromagnetic coefficient approximately equals: 176 × 10^9^ C kg^−1^.'
