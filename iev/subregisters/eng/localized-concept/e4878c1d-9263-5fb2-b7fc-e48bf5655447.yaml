  definition: time interval required for the trailing edge of a waveform to change
    between two defined levels which may be either the logic levels `V`~OH~ and `V`~OL~
    [being at 90 % and 10 %, respectively, of the maximum amplitude (equalling `V`~HI~
    – `V`~LO~)], or any other ratio as defined in the detail specification where `V`~OL~
    is the low level output voltage `V`~OH~ is the high level output voltage `V`~HI~
    is the upper flat voltage of the pulse waveform `V`~LO~ is the low flat voltage
    of the pulse waveform image::/assets/images/parts/561/561-fig17-en.png[] *Figure
