  definition: 'function `f` that attributes a scalar `f ( U , V )` to any pair of
    vectors *`U`* and *`V`* in a given vector space, with the following properties:
    * `f ( alpha U , V ) = alpha f ( U , V )` and `f ( U , beta V ) = beta f ( U ,
    V )` where `α` and `β` are scalars, * `f ( U + V , W ) = f ( U , W ) + f ( V ,
    W )` and `f ( W , U + V ) = f ( W , U ) + f ( W , V )` for any vector *`W`* existing
    in the same vector space'

  notes:
  - A bilinear form over an `n`-dimensional vector space can be represented by a square
    matrix `( k_((i j)) )` and the scalar is `f ( U , V ) = underset((i j))( sum )
    k_((i j)) U_i V_j`.
  - The bilinear forms over a given `n`-dimensional vector space constitute an `n^2`-dimensional
    vector space.
  - The concept of bilinear form extends to "linear form" in the case of one vector
    and to "multilinear form" (or `m`-linear form) in the case of an ordered set of
    `m` vectors.
