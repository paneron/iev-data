  notes:
  - The value of the function `f` of `n` variables `x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n` is denoted
    by `f ( x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n )`.
  - In many practical applications in electrotechnology, functions of one variable
    are used. This variable is often the duration and the function is then called
    "function of time" and denoted by `f`(`t`). But the variables may also be space
    variables (e.g. coordinates), frequency, etc.
