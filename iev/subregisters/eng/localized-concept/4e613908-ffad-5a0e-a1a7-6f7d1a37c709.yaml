  definition: for a plane surface S and a specified axis perpendicular to the plane
    of the surface, additive scalar quantity equal to the integral `I_p = int_S R^2
    d A`, where `R` is the distance between a surface element with area d`A` and the
    axis

  notes:
  - 1 The second polar moment of area is sometimes given the wrong name "moment of
    inertia" but should not to be confused with the quantity "moment of inertia".
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of second polar moment of area is metre to the power four,
    m^4^.
