  definition: 'the energy imparted by ionizing radiation to the matter in a volume
    `epsilon = sum epsilon_((in)) - sum epsilon_((ex)) + sum Q` where Σ`ε`~in~ is
    the sum of the energies (excluding rest energies) of all directly and indirectly
    ionizing particles incident on the volume, Σ`ε`~ex~ is the sum of the energies
    (excluding rest energies) of all directly and indirectly ionizing particles emerging
    from the volume, and Σ`Q` is the sum of all changes (decreases: positive sign;
    increases: negative sign) of rest energy of nuclei and elementary particles in
    any transformations which occur in the volume'
