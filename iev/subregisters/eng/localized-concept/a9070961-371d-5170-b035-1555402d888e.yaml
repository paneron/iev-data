  notes:
  - 1 For a system of particles with masses `m`~`i`~ and position vectors *`r`*~`i`~,
    the centre of mass is the point with position vector `r_G = ((sum_i m_i r_i))/((sum_i
    m_i))`.
  - 2 In non-relativistic physics, the centre of mass doesn’t depend on the chosen
    reference frame.
