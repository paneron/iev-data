  notes:
  - An example of a four-wire circuit is one formed from two pairs of metallic conductors
    arranged as two channels, one in each direction.
  - Certain types of four-wire circuit, such as frequency separation of go and return
    channels over the same pair, were formerly known as four-wire type circuits. The
    term "four-wire type circuit" is deprecated.
