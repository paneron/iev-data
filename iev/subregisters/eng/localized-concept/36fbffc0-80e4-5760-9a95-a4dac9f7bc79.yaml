  definition: force *`F`* exerted on a particle having electric charge `Q` and velocity
    *`v`* , given by the relation *`F`* = `Q`(*`E`* + *`v`* x *`B`*) where *`E`* is
    the electric field strength and *`B`* the magnetic flux density

  notes:
  - The component vector `Q` *`E`*  is the Coulomb force.
  - The component vector `Q` *`v`* Ã— *`B`*  is the Lorentz force.
