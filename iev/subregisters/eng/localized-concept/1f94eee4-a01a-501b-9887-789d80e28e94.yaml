  definition: linear time-invariant transfer element the transfer function of which
    may be written as a quotient of two polynomials in `s` `G ( s ) = ((V ( s )))/((U
    ( s ))) = ((b_0 + b_1 * s + ... + b_m * s^m))/((a_0 + a_1 * s + ... + a_n * s^n))`
    with `aj` and `bj` real, `an` ≠ 0, `bm` ≠ 0 where<table> <tr> <td> `ai`, `bi`
    </td> <td>are the polynomial coefficients;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>`s`</td> <td>is
    the complex variable of the Laplace transform;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> `U`(`s`)</td>
    <td>is the input transform;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> `V`(`s`)</td> <td>is the output
    transform.</td> </tr> </table>

  notes:
  - In real controlled systems, `m` &lt; `n`. With respect to mathematical denomination
    these elements would have to be called "proper-fractional rational transfer element"
    which is not usage.
  - An element with dead time is an example for a non-rational transfer element.
