  notes:
  - The signal cannot generally be separated from noise, and in practice the ratio
    (signal+noise) to noise is measured.
  - 'The specified conditions comprise among others:


    – the nature and characteristics of the wanted signal,


    – the nature and characteristics of the noise,


    – the receiver and antenna characteristics such as the bandwidth.'
