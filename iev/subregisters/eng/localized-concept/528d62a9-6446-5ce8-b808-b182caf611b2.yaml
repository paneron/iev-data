  definition: density of incident photon flux with respect to area at a point on a
    real or imaginary surface `E_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d A))` where `Φ`~p~ is photon flux
    and `A` is the area on which the photon flux is incident

  notes:
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "irradiance". The corresponding photometric
    quantity is "illuminance".
  - The photon irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one per square
    metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-39 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
