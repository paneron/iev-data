  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists in symmetrical
    and unsymmetrical three-phase system(s) of sinusoidal quantities and which is
    defined by the following complex mathematical expression: `X`~1~ = 1/3(`X`~L1~
    + `aX`~L2~ + `a`^2^`X`~L3~) where `a` is the 120 degree operator, and `X`~L1~,
    `X`~L2~ and `X`~L3~ are the complex expressions of the phase quantities concerned,
    and where `X` denotes the system current or voltage phasors'
