  definition: 'the quantity which characterizes that part of profile dispersion due
    to a variation of refractive index contrast with wavelength given by: `P ( lambda
    ) = ((n_((1 )) lambda d Delta))/((N_1 Delta d lambda))` where `n`~1~ is the maximum
    refractive index of the core, `N`~1~ is the group index corresponding to `n`~1~
    calculated from the formula: `N`~1~ = `n`~1~ = `λ` (d`n`~1~ / d`λ`) Δ is the refractive
    index contrast, `λ` is the wavelength in vacuum'
