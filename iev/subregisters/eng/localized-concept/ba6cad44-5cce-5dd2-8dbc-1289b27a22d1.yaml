  notes:
  - It may be necessary to assign different thermal classes to the same material or
    system for different service conditions.
  - The description of  an electrotechnical product as being of a particular thermal
    class does not mean, and must not be taken to imply that each insulating material
    used in its construction is of the same thermal capability.
