  definition: quotient of the relative change of saturation magnetization due to a
    change in temperature by that change in temperature `alpha_((M s)) = ((M_((s Theta))
    - M_((sref))))/((M_((sref)) ( Theta - Theta_((ref)) )))` where `M`~s`Θ`~ and `M`~sref~
    are the saturation magnetizations at temperatures of `Θ` and `Θ`~ref~ respectively
