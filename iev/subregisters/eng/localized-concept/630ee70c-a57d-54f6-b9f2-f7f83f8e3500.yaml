  notes:
  - The smaller the sensitive part of the {{sensor, IEV:151-13-48}}, 1) the less interference
    with the measuring object, 2) the higher the {{signal-to-noise ratio, IEV:161-06-04}}
    in the measurement, and 3) the more small-area local data can be obtained. An
    integrated microprobe is a {{device, IEV:151-11-20}} consisting of a microprobe
    prepared by micromachining silicon to an ultra-microscopic needle and incorporating
    a signal processing circuit. Integrated microprobes, made by machining silicon
    needles to a diameter of from several nanometres to several micrometres and combining
    them with an impedance conversion circuit, etc., are in actual use as microscopic
    {{electrodes, IEV:891-01-17}} for organisms, scanning tunnelling microscopes (STMs),
    and {{atomic force microscopes, IEV:523-07-02}} (AFMs).
