  definition: luminous flux emitted within a specified cone angle, `α`, determined
    from the luminous intensity distribution, `I`~v~(`θ`,`φ`), of the light source
    `Phi_((v ,p , alpha)) = int_((phi = 0))^((2 pi)) int_((theta = 0))^((alpha //
    2)) I_v ( theta , phi ) sin theta d theta d phi`

  notes:
  - (`θ`,`φ`) = (0,0) is the direction of the cone axis, which can be coincident with
    the mechanical axis or optical beam axis of the light source or any other direction,
    and should be specified.
  - The cone angle, `α`, which can be expressed either in degree (°) or radian (rad),
    is given by the full conic angle and has to be specified, e.g. `Φ`~p,90°~ or `Φ`~p,π/2~.
  - The term "cone luminous flux" is also used in some applications with the same
    meaning.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-21-111">useful luminous flux</a>".
  - The partial luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
