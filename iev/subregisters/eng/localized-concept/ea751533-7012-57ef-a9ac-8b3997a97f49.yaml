  definition: mean value of irradiance on the outer curved surface of a very small
    (real or imaginary) sphere at a point in space

  notes:
  - 'The spherical irradiance can be expressed by


    `E_((e,o)) = int_((4 pi)) L_e d omega`


    where `Ω` is solid angle and `L`~e~ is radiance.'
  - The spherical irradiance is the quotient of the radiant flux of all the radiation
    incident on the outer surface of an infinitely small sphere centred at the specified
    point and the area of the diametrical cross-section of that sphere.
  - The analogous quantities "spherical illuminance", `E`~v,o~, and "photon spherical
    irradiance", `E`~p,o~, are defined in a similar way, replacing radiance, `L`~e~,
    by luminance, `L`~v~, and photon radiance, `L`~p~, respectively.
  - The spherical irradiance is the appropriate radiometric quantity for describing
    a dose rate for a photobiological or photochemical effect in a scattering medium
    (e.g. light in skin). The spherical irradiance is also the appropriate quantity
    for describing the irradiation of microorganisms. The spherical irradiance is
    frequently used incorrectly as a substitute for irradiance in some publications.
  - The spherical irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
