  definition: the relative permeability obtained from the peak magnetic flux density
    divided by `sqrt(2)` and the RMS value of the applied magnetic field strength
    at a stated peak value of the flux density, when the flux density is varying sinusoidally
    with time with an average value of zero and the material is initially in a specified
    neutralized state
