  definition: 'quotient NC/ND of two collinear distances on the chromaticity diagram
    of the CIE 1931 or 1964 standard colorimetric systems, the first distance being
    that between the point C representing the colour stimulus considered and the point
    N representing the specified achromatic stimulus, the second distance being that
    between the point N and the point D on the spectrum locus at the dominant wavelength
    of the colour stimulus considered, leading to the following expressions: `p_e
    = ((y - y_n))/((y_d - y_n))` and `p_e = ((x - x_n))/((x_d - x_n))` where (`x`,
    `y`), (`x`~n~, `y`~n~), (`x`~d~, `y`~d~) are the `x`, `y` chromaticity coordinates
    of the points C, N and D respectively'

  notes:
  - In the case of purple stimuli, the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    whose chromaticity is represented by a point on the purple boundary.
  - The formulae in `x` and `y` are equivalent, but greater precision is given by
    the formula which has the greater value in the numerator.
  - 'The excitation purity, `p`~e~, is related to the colorimetric purity, `p`~c~,
    by the equation:


    `p_e = ((p_c y))/((y_d))`'
  - The excitation purity has unit one.
