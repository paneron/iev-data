  definition: 'of a material saturated by a magnetostatic field, the complex permeability
    when it is subjected to an electromagnetic wave having a circularly polarized
    `vec H` field component in the plane perpendicular to the magnetostatic field
    strength: `μ`~+~ = `μ`~r~ + `κ`~r~ `μ`~−~ = `μ`~r~ − `κ`~r~ where `μ`~r~ and `κ`~r~
    are components of Polder''s tensor permeability'

  notes:
  - The subscript of `µ` corresponds to the sign in the mathematical expression; `μ`~+~
    is applicable where the `vec H` field rotates counterclockwise as a function of
    time when seen in the direction of the applied magnetostatic field; `μ`~−~ is
    applicable to the reverse rotation.
