  notes:
  - A lab-on-a-chip is a chip including systems for metering, measuring, and mixing
    microscopic liquid samples with reagents, moving the mixtures to an integrated
    temperature-controlled reaction chamber, and separating and determining the results
    with an on-board detector. A lab-on-a-chip can be used both for analysis and for
    synthesis.
