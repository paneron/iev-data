  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of displacement Δ`x` of one
    surface of a layer of thickness `d` to the other surface parallel to it, to this
    thickness, thus `γ` = Δ`x` / `d`

  notes:
  - In anisotropic media, shear strain may depend on the orientation of the layer
    and may be described by a tensor.
