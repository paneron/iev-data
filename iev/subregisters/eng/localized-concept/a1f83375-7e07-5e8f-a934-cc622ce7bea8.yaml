  notes:
  - This term is used in the "uncertainty" approach.
  - The parameter can be, for example, a standard deviation (or a given multiple of
    it), or a half-width of an interval having a stated level of confidence. Various
    ways of obtaining uncertainty are defined in the GUM.
  - Uncertainty of measurement comprises, in general, many components. Some of these
    components can be evaluated from the statistical distribution of the results of
    a series of measurements and can be characterized by experimental standard deviations.
    The other components, which can also be characterized by standard deviations,
    are evaluated from the assumed probability distributions based on experience or
    other information.
