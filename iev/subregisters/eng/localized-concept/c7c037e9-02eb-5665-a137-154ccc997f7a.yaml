  notes:
  - 1 A adiabatic wall has the opposite property as an diathermic wall.
  - 2 An approximation of an adiabatic enclosure is e.g. a thermos flask. An approximation
    of an adiabatic process is a process occurring inside a thermo flask or a process
    passing so quickly that the exchange of heat with its surrounding is negligible.
