  notes:
  - The enclosure of the non-incendive component is not intended to either exclude
    the explosive gas atmosphere or contain an explosion. This is usually applied
    to specially constructed switch contacts that are mechanically designed to quench
    any arc or spark so that they are not a source of ignition.
