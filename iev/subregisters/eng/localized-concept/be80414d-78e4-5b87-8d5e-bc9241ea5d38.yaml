  definition: complex representation `underset(_)(a) ( alpha , t ) = A_0 exp j ( omega
    t - p alpha + vartheta_0 )` of a rotating sinusoidal field quantity, where `A_0`
    is the amplitude, `ω` is the angular frequency, `t` is time, `p` is an integer,
    `α` is angular position, `vartheta_0` is initial phase, and j is the imaginary
    unit
