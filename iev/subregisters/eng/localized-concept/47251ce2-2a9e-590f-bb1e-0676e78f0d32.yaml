  notes:
  - 'The optical beam axis is not necessarily the same as the lamp axis through the
    lamp cap or the lamp axis normal to a reference plane. The following figure illustrates
    the relation between the optical beam axis, the mechanical/geometrical axis, the
    peak intensity and the centre beam intensity.
