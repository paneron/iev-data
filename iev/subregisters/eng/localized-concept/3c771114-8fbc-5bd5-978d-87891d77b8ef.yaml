  definition: 'one of the following two quotients: a) for transduction of an electric
    signal into a mechanical signal, quotient of the resulting force in the blocked
    mechanical system by the excitation voltage in the electrical system; b) for transduction
    of a mechanical signal into an electric signal, quotient of the resulting short-circuit
    current in the electrical system by the excitation velocity in the mechanical
    system'

  notes:
  - These definitions are best applied to a reciprocal electromechanical transducer
    with transformer coupling, for example an electrostatic or piezoelectric transducer,
    in which case the two quotients have equal magnitude.
