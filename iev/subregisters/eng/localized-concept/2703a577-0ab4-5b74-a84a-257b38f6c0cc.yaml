  notes:
  - The equipment housing can offer protection to personnel, e.g. from electric shock.
    Where the equipment housing provides the full required environmental protection,
    then it is treated as a cubicle to define the relevant environmental parameters.
    The equipment housing normally contains only a single supplierâ€™s equipment, and
    is only a part of a signalling or telecommunications system.
