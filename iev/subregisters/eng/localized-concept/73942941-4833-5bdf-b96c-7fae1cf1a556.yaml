  notes:
  - 'On the basis of identical positive or negative half cycles of the input source:


    – generalized phase control is symmetrical if the current waveform is the same
    for both positive and negative half cycles;


    – multicycle control is symmetrical if within each conduction period the number
    of positive and negative half cycles is equal.'
