  notes:
  - A dormant fault becomes active in response to a specific trigger ({{192-03-23,
    IEV:192-03-23}}), and may revert to being dormant once the trigger is removed.
  - The error so caused may propagate and lead to a failure observed at the system
    boundary, unless this is prevented by error recovery ({{192-10-16, IEV:192-10-16}}).
