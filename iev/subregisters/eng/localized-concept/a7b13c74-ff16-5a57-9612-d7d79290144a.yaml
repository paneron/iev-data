  notes:
  - Insulating materials or objects are neither conductive nor dissipative. Electrostatic
    charges can accumulate on them and do not readily dissipate even when they are
    in contact with the earth.
  - 'Boundary limits for the insulating range are given for solid materials, enclosures,
    some objects and for bulk materials are given in IEC TS 60079-32-1, _Explosive
    atmospheres – Part 32-1: Electrostatic hazards, guidance_. For certain items,
    special definitions are maintained in other standards.'
  - Product standards and other standards covering electrostatic properties often
    include specific definitions of "insulating" which apply only to items covered
    by those standards and can be different to the definitions given here. See e.g.
    ISO 8031, _Rubber and plastics hoses and hose assemblies – Determination of electrical
    resistance and conductivity_, and ISO 8330, _Rubber and plastics hoses and hose
    assemblies – Vocabulary_, for hose and hose assemblies.
  - The adjective "non-conductive" has often been used as a synonym for insulating.
    It should be avoided as it could be taken to mean either "insulating" or "insulating
    or dissipative" and this can lead to confusion.
