  definition: 'macroscopic quantum effect in which, when a direct current (DC) voltage
    `U` is applied across a Josephson junction, an alternating current of Cooper pairs
    flows by tunnel effect through the junction, generating the emission of electromagnetic
    wave having a frequency `f` proportional to the applied voltage and satisfying
    the relation: `f` = `2eU/h` where `h` is the Planck constant and `e` is the elementary
    electric charge'

  notes:
  - The AC Josephson effect also manifests itself conversely so that, when a Josephson
    junction is irradiated by an electromagnetic radiation of frequency `f,` the voltage
    across it can assume quantized values equal to (`h`/2`e`)`nf`, where `n` is an
    integer.
  - '`f/U` = 483,6 MHz/Î¼V.'
