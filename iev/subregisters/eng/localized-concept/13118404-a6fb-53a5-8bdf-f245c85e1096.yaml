  definition: scalar quantity equal to the scalar line integral of a force *`F`* acting
    on a particle along a given path C, thus `W` = ∫~C~ *`F`* ⋅ d*`r`*, where d*`r`*
    is vector line element

  notes:
  - 1 Work is energy transferred in a special manner and thus is a process quantity
    ({{113-04-10, IEV:113-04-10}}). Work `W` changes the internal energy `E` ({{113-04-20,
    IEV:113-04-20}}) of a body for Δ`E` = `W`, where `E` is a state quantity ({{113-04-09,
    IEV:113-04-09}}).
  - '2 In applications, work is often calculated as the time integral of power `P`:
    `W = int_(t_1)^(t_2) P d t`.'
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of work is joule, J.
