  definition: the transmission loss that would occur if the antennas were replaced
    by isotropic antennas with the same polarization as the real antennas, the propagation
    path being retained, but the effects of obstacles close to the antennas being
    disregarded

  notes:
  - The basic transmission loss is equal to the ratio of the equivalent isotropically
    radiated power of the transmitter system and the power available from an isotropic
    receiving antenna.
  - The effect of the local ground close to the antenna is included in computing the
    antenna gain, but not in the basic transmission loss.
