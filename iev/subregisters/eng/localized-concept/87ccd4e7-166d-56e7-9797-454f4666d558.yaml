  definition: axial vector `U xx V`, orthogonal to two given vectors *`U`* and *`V`*,
    such that the three vectors *`U`*, *`V`* and `U xx V` form a right-handed trihedron
    or a left-handed trihedron according to the space orientation, with its magnitude
    equal to the product of the magnitudes of the given vectors and the sine of the
    angle `vartheta` between them `| U xx V | = | U | * | V | * sin vartheta`

  notes:
  - In the three-dimensional Euclidean space with given space orientation, the vector
    product of two vectors *`U`* and *`V`* is the unique axial vector `U xx V` such
    that for any vector *`W`* in the same vector space the scalar triple product (*`U`*,*`V`*,*`W`*)
    is equal to the scalar product `( U xx V ) * W`.
  - 'For two vectors `U = U_x e_x + U_y e_y + U_z e_z` and `V = V_x e_x + V_y e_y
    + V_z e_z`, where `e_x , e_y , e_z` is an orthonormal base, the vector product
    is expressed by `U xx V = ( U_y V_z - U_z V_y ) e_x + ( U_z V_x - U_x V_z ) e_y
    + ( U_x V_y - U_y V_x ) e_z`.


    The vector product can also be expressed as `U xx V = | [[e_x,e_y,e_z],[U_x,U_y,U_z],[V_x,V_y,V_z]]
    |` using a sum similar to the sum used to obtain the determinant of a matrix.
    The vector product is therefore the axial vector associated with the antisymmetric
    tensor `U ox V - V ox U` (see {{IEV 102-03-43, IEV:102-03-43}}).'
  - For two complex vectors *`U`* and *`V`*, either the vector product `U xx V` or
    one of the vector products `U^( * ) xx V` or `U xx V^( * )` may be used depending
    on the application.
  - A vector product can be similarly defined for a pair consisting of a polar vector
    and an axial vector and is then a polar vector, or for a pair of two axial vectors
    and is then an axial vector.
  - In the usual three-dimensional space, the vector product of two vector quantities
    is the vector product of the associated unit vectors multiplied by the product
    of the scalar quantities.
  - The vector product operation is denoted by a cross (×) between the two symbols
    representing the vectors. The use of the symbol ∧ is deprecated.
