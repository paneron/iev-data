  notes:
  - The components of an antisymmetric tensor are such that `T_((i j)) = - T_((j i))`,
    and in particular `T_((i i)) = 0`.
  - 'An antisymmetric tensor defined on a three-dimensional space has three strict
    components which can be considered as the coordinates `W_1 , W_2 , W_3` of an
    axial vector:


    `( [[0,W_3,- W_2],[- W_3,0,W_1],[W_2,- W_1,0]] )`


    The axial vector associated with the antisymmetric tensor `U ox V - V ox U` is
    the vector product of the two vectors.'
