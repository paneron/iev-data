  definition: self-acting artificial system the behaviour of which is governed either
    in a stepwise manner by given decision rules or continuously in time by defined
    relationships, while the output variables of which are created from its input
    and state variables
  examples:
  - '1: In a vending machine the program is started by inserting a coin. The program
    can respond in two ways: either accept the coin and release the article or return
    the coin with the article output remaining blocked. The decision is made based
    on the result of the check of the inserted coin and the article stock.'
  - '2: A machine tool which automatically executes operations under program control
    is an automaton. Examples: automatic lathe, milling machine.'
  - '3: In a temperature controller a reference variable is set, which will be compared
    with the feedback variable. Based on the result of the comparison the controller
    drives the final controlling equipment. In other words, based on the difference
    between the reference variable and the feedback variable (representing the temperature
    as controlled variable) the controller and the final controlling equipment influence
    the temperature via the manipulated variable (output variable).'

  notes:
  - An essential characteristic of a program controlled automaton is the existence
    of at least one branching in the program, offering different alternatives of control
    actions between which a decision is made based on external inputs or inner states.
    Deactivation, too, is an alternative branch of the program. The program sequence
    is triggered or controlled by an external stimulus which is part of an external
    input or the input itself.
  - A controller, governed by the defined relationships in a control loop is an automaton.
