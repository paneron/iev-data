  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between the magnetic
    losses `Pα`, measured at an angle `α` to the direction of rolling, and the magnetic
    losses, `P`~0~, measured along the direction of rolling, to `P`~0~, the ratio
    being expressed as a percentage: `T_L = ((P_(alpha) - P_0))/((P_0)) xx 100 %`'

  notes:
  - The measurements of `Pα` and `P`~0~ are to be made under the same conditions.
  - The loss anisotropy factor at a given angle differs both conceptually and numerically
    from the loss anisotropy factor `T` ({{IEV 221-03-38, IEV:221-03-38}}).
