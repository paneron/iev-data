  definition: for a square matrix *`A`* of order `n` with the real or complex elements
    `Aij`, non-negative number `‖ A ‖ = sqrt(tr ( A A^H )) = sqrt(sum_((i , j = 1))^n
    | A_((i j)) |^2)`

  notes:
  - The described norm is the "Euclidean norm" or the "Hermitian norm" for the real
    and the complex case, respectively. Several other norms of a matrix can be defined.
    Any norm of a matrix has properties similar to the properties of the magnitude
    of a vector (see Note 1 to entry in {{IEV 102-03-23, IEV:102-03-23}}).
