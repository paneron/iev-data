  definition: optical device that modifies a beam of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical
    radiation</a> to produce a beam of <a href="IEV845-21-021">unpolarized radiation</a>
    irrespective of the state of polarization of the incident radiation

  notes:
  - No simple and completely satisfactory way of depolarizing a beam of radiation
    is known. The methods employed usually produce a large variety of polarization
    states with respect to time, wavelength or the aperture of the beam. Devices functioning
    on this principle are usually known as pseudo-depolarizers.
