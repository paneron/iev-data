  definition: 'for a linear passive two-terminal-pair network terminated with its
    image impedances, half the natural logarithm of the product of the phasors <u>`U`</u>~1~
    and <u>`I`</u>~1~ representing the voltage and the electric current at the input
    divided by the product of the phasors <u>`U`</u>~2~ and <u>`I`</u>~2~ representing
    the voltage and the current at the output: `(1)/(2) ln (((underset(_)(U))_1 (underset(_)(I))_1))/(((underset(_)(U))_2
    (underset(_)(I))_2))`'
