  notes:
  - Electrical insulating gloves are normally used in conjunction with leather over-glove
    to provide mechanical protection.
  - This entry was numbered 651-07-09 in IEC 60050-651:1999. It has been modified
    to precise the type of protection of the worker. The term “electrical hazards”
    was too generic; it has been replaced by “electric shock”, which is more precise.
