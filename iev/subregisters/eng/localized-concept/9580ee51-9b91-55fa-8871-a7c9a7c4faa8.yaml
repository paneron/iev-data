  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the electric flux density is at all points equal to the product of
    the electric field strength and the electric constant:


    *`D`* = `ε`~0~ *`E`*'
  - 'The divergence of the electric flux density is equal to the volumic electric
    charge `ρ` :


    div *`D`* = `ρ`'
