    same in all directions of the hemisphere above the surface

  notes:
  - 'Lambert''s cosine law can be expressed by


    `I`(`θ`) = `I`~n ~cos `θ`


    where `I`(`θ`) and `I`~n~ are the radiant intensities or luminous intensities
    of the surface element in a direction at an angle, `θ`, from the normal to the
    surface and in the direction of that normal, respectively.'
