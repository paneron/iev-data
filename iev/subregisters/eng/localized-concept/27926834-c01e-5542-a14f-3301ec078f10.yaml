  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of
    amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6,022 140 76 × 10^23^ elementary
    entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, `N`~A~,
    when expressed in the unit mol^−1^ and is called the Avogadro number.


    The amount of substance, symbol `n`, of a system is a measure of the number of
    specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule,
    an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles."'
  - The definition of the mole in IEV 112-02-09:2010-01 fixed the value of the molar
    mass of carbon 12, `M`(^12^C), as exactly equal to 0,012 kg/mol. According to
    the current definition of the mole, `M`(^12^C) is no longer known precisely and
    has to be determined experimentally.
  - 'The mole is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: {{second, IEV:112-02-04}}
    (s), {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}} (m), {{kilogram, IEV:112-02-06}} (kg), {{ampere,
    IEV:112-02-08}} (A), {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), mole (mol) and {{candela,
    IEV:112-02-10}} (cd).'
