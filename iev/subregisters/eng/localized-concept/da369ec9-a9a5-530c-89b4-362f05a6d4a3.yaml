  definition: sum of the reflected spectral radiance factor, `β`~R~(`λ`), and the
    luminescent spectral radiance factor, `β`~L~(`λ`) `β`~T~(`λ`) = `β`~R~(`λ`) +
    `β`~L~(`λ`)

  notes:
  - For fluorescence colorimetric applications, it is implicit that the quantity used
    in the colorimetric calculations is the total radiance factor, and it is common
    to omit the subscript T.
  - The total spectral radiance factor has unit one.
