  definition: 'for a complex matrix *`A`* with elements `Aij`, matrix denoted by *`A`*^H^,
    equal to the complex conjugate of the transpose matrix: *`A`*^H^ = (*`A`*^T^)*
    or for elements `(( A^( H ) ))_((i j)) = A_(j i)^( * )`'

  notes:
  - If the matrix *`A`* is real, the Hermitian conjugate matrix reduces to the transpose
    matrix.
  - The Hermitian conjugate matrix of a matrix *`A`* is denoted by *`A`*^H^ or sometimes
    *`A`*^â€ ^. The notation *`A`** is also used in mathematics.
