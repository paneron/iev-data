  definition: technique of {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} a glass {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}},
    which contains movable ions, and a substrate of silicon, metal, and so on, where
    the substrates are softened by heat, and bonded by the electrostatic attraction
    of a {{double layer, IEV:114-02-19}} produced by applying a high voltage across
    the substrates with the glass side as cathode

  notes:
  - High-precision bonding is achieved owing to the bonding process in the substrates'
    solid state. The bonding strength largely depends on the flatness of the surfaces,
    although this is not as critical as for silicon fusion bonding. Bonding silicon
    {{wafers, IEV:521-05-29}} with materials such as borosilicate or tempered glass
    enables structures with internal cavities, such as capacitive pressure {{sensors,
    IEV:151-13-48}} and {{micropumps, IEV:523-04-16}}, to be fabricated. When bonding
    two silicon wafers or a silicon wafer and a metal wafer, a thin glass film is
    formed on the contacting surface of the wafers, or the surface of the silicon
    wafer is oxidized. The problem with the use of thin films is that, at high bonding
    temperatures, the dielectric breakdown voltage of the films is lowered to the
    point that sufficient voltage cannot be applied. To reduce the process temperature
    to room temperature, attempts are being made to form a glass film with a low melting
    point by {{sputtering, IEV:521-03-17}}. This resolves problems such as the strain
    and deformation caused by thermal stress, and introduces benefits such as improvement
    in precision and widening the choice of materials.
