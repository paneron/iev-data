  definition: quotient of the recombination rate by the product of the number densities
    `n`^+^ and `n`^âˆ’^ of the recombining charge carriers, thus `- ((d n^( + )))/((d
    t)) = - ((d n^( - )))/((d t)) = alpha n^( + ) n^( - )`

  notes:
  - The coherent SI unit of recombination coefficient is metre cube per second, m^3^
    / s.
