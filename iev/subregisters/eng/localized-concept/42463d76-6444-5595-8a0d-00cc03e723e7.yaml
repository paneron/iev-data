  definition: the ratios of the coefficients of the linear combination of independent
    modes of propagation that represents a degenerate mode in a waveguide

  notes:
  - If there are exactly `n` independent modes of propagation there will be at most
    `n` â€”1 independent ratios that describe completely the polarization of a given
    degenerate mode.
  - In a waveguide with square or circular cross-section there are two independent
    modes of propagation, and a single ratio describes the polarization of a given
    degenerate mode.
