  notes:
  - 1 Internal energy may be expressed as a function of the state quantities of the
    system such as temperature, pressure, volume, masses, or amounts of substance.
  - 2 For a closed thermodynamic system, Î”`U` = `Q` + `W`, where `Q` is amount of
    heat transferred to the system and `W` is work done on the system provided that
    no chemical reactions occur.
  - 3 Specific internal energy, or internal energy per mass, is denoted `u`.
