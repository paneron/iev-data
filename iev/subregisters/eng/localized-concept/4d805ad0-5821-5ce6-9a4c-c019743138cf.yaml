  definition: 'for a resistive two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, derivative of the voltage `u`~AB~ [{{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}] between
    the terminals with respect to the electric current `i` in the element or circuit:
    `R_d = ((d u_((AB))))/((d i))` where the electric current is taken as positive
    if its direction is from A to B and negative in the opposite case'

  notes:
  - For an ideal resistor, the differential resistance `R`~d~ is equal to its resistance
    `R`.
