  definition: criterion to determine the critical current, `I`~c~, based on the electric
    field strength, `E`, or the resistivity, `ρ`

  notes:
  - '`E` = 10 μV/m or `E` = 100 μV/m is often used as electric field criterion, and
    `ρ` = 10^−14^ Ω·m or `ρ` = 10^−13^ Ω·m is often used as resistivity criterion.'
