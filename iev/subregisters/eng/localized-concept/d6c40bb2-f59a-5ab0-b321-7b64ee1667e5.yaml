  definition: dose equivalent at a point in a radiation field, produced by the corresponding
    aligned and expanded field, in the ICRU sphere at a depth `d`, on the radius opposing
    the direction of the aligned field

  notes:
  - In defining these quantities, it is useful to stipulate certain radiation fields
    that are derived from the actual radiation field. The terms "expanded" and "aligned"
    are used to characterise these derived radiation fields. In the expanded field,
    the fluence and its angular and energy distribution have the same values throughout
    the volume of interest as in the actual field at the point of reference. In the
    aligned and expanded field, the fluence and its energy distribution are the same
    as in the expanded field but the fluence is unidirectional.
  - The ICRU sphere is a 30 cm diameter, tissue-equivalent sphere with a volumic mass
    of 1 g/cm3 and a mass composition of tissue equivalent material (see 393-14-78).
  - The recommended depth `d`, for environmental monitoring in terms of `H`*(`d`)
    is 10 mm, and `H`*(`d`) may then be written as `H`*(10).
  - An instrument that has an isotropic response and is calibrated in terms of `H`*(`d`)
    will measure `H`*(`d`) in any radiation fields that are uniform over the dimensions
    of the instrument.
  - The definition of `H`*(`d`) requires the design of the instrument to take account
    of backscatter.
