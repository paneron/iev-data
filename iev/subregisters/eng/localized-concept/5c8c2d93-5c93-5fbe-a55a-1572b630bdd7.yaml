  notes:
  - Surface micromachining is a processing technique that applies for example chemical
    vapour deposition (CVD) to form various thin films on the substrate and uses a
    mask to perform selective removal of the substrate surface to produce movable
    parts and other structures. The dissolved layer that was deposited initially is
    called the sacrificial layer. A typical sacrificial layer material is phosphosilicate
    glass (PSG). This technology is applied to the fabrication of micro-beams, bearings,
    and links, etc.
