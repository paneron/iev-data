  notes:
  - 'Photon cylindrical irradiance is sometimes also defined as the arithmetic mean
    of the vertical photon irradiance, `E`~p,v~, at a point


    `E_((p ,c)) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_0^((2 pi)) E_((p ,v)) d phi`


    where `E`~p,v~ is the vertical photon irradiance for an area element with its
    normal in the direction `φ`, and `φ` is the angle in the plane perpendicular to
    the axis of the cylinder.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "cylindrical irradiance". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "cylindrical illuminance".
  - The photon cylindrical irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one
    per square metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
