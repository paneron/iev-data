  notes:
  - The word "main" is used even if a subscriber's main station has no extensions
    since such a station is counted as a main station for administrative purposes.
    By the same convention, an installation with one or more subscriber's lines is
    considered to contain the same number of subscriber's main stations as it has
    subscriber's lines.
  - When two or more subscriber's stations are connected in parallel, usually one
    is designated as the subscriber's main station, the others as extensions.
