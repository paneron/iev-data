  notes:
  - The natural viewing environment in image capture and reproduction is highly complex.
    Light can be generated by the image, by the display device, by the area immediately
    surrounding the display device and by the space in which the image is being displayed.
    The ambient illuminance level describes the light that reaches the observer that
    does not originate with the image, with the surround or with the background.
