  notes:
  - 'The range between 100 nm and 400 nm is commonly subdivided into:


    * UV-A: 315 nm to 400 nm;


    * UV-B: 280 nm to 315 nm;


    * UV-C: 100 nm to 280 nm.'
  - A precise border between ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation cannot be
    defined, because visual sensation at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm is noted
    for very bright sources.
  - In some applications the ultraviolet spectrum has also been divided into "far,"
    "vacuum," and "near" ultraviolet; however, the borders necessarily vary with the
    application (e.g. in meteorology, optical design, photochemistry, and thermal
    physics).
