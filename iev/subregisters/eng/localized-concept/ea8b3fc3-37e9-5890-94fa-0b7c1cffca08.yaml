  definition: 'a criterion which characterizes the degree of roughness of a surface,
    for a given grazing angle of an electromagnetic wave according to the value of
    the quantity: `((h sin theta))/(lambda)` where `h` is the average height of the
    surface irregularities, `θ` is the grazing angle relative to the average surface,
    `λ` is the wavelength'

  notes:
  - 'In practice, roughness is negligible and the surface is considered specular if:


    `((h sin theta))/(lambda) (1)/((1 0 0))`'
