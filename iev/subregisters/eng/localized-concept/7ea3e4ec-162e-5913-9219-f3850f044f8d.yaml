    flux density, magnetic polarization or magnetization is alternating at an amplitude
    corresponding to the saturation hysteresis loop

  notes:
  - 'The relevant parameter should be stated, and the appropriate symbol used as follows
    : `H''`~c`B`~ for the cyclic coercivity relating to the flux density, `H''`~c`J`~
    for the cyclic coercivity relating to the polarization, `H''`~c`M`~ for the cyclic
    coercivity relating to the magnetization. The first two symbols supersede `BH''`~c~
    and `JH''`~c~.'
