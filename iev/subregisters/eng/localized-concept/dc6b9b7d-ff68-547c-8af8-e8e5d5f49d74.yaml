  definition: law relating the apparent contrast, `Cd`, of an object against a sky
    background, at a given distance of observation, `d`, to the inherent contrast,
    `C`~0~, and to the atmospheric transmissivity, `T`, which is assumed to be uniform
    `C_d = C_0 T^(d // d_0)` where `d`~0~ is the length specified for the definition
    of `T`

  notes:
  - 'The formula is sometimes written


    `C_d = C_0 T^(delta)`


    where the exponent, `δ`, in `Tδ` is the numerical value of `d` measured with `d`~0~
    as "unit".'
  - 'Taking into account the relationship between atmospheric transmissivity, `T`,
    and meteorological optical range, `v`, given in Note 2 to entry of "<a href="IEV845-31-018">meteorological
    optical range</a>", Koschmieder''s law can be also written as


    `C_d = C_0 ( 0,05^(d // v) )`'
  - The contrast is taken to be the quotient of the difference between the luminance
    of the object and the luminance of the background, and the luminance of the background.
