  notes:
  - In case of insulating materials, the temperature index is derived from the thermal
    endurance relationship at a given time, normally 20 000 hours. It may be used
    as basis for determination of the materialâ€™s temperature class.
  - In case of insulation systems, the temperature index may be derived from known
    service experience or from a known comparative functional evaluation of an evaluated
    and established reference insulation system as basis.
