  definition: for a body and a specified axis, scalar quantity equal to the integral
    `J` = ∫~D~ `R`^2^ d`m` = ∫~D~ `R`^2^ `ρ` d`V`, where `ρ` is mass density in a
    domain D with quasi-infinitesimal mass d`m` and volume d`V`, and `R` is the distance
    between the domain and the axis

  notes:
  - 1 For a material point, the moment of inertia is equal to the product of its mass
    `m` and the square of its distance `R` to the axis, thus `J` = `mR`^2^. For a
    system of particles, it is equal to the sum of their moments of inertia.
  - 2 In non-relativistic physics, moment of inertia is an additive quantity.
  - 3 More generally, moment of inertia can be defined for a rigid body as a tensor
    quantity `vec vec J`, where `J`~`xx`~ = −∫(`y`^2^ + `z`^2^) d`m`, cycl., cycl.,
    and `J`~`yz`~ = −∫ `yz` d`m`, cycl. cycl.
  - 4 The moment of inertia is not to be confused with the second axial moment of
    area and the second polar moment of area.
  - 5 The coherent SI unit of moment of inertia is kilogram metre squared, kg·m^2^.
