  definition: ordered set of `n` linearly independent vectors `a_1 , a_2 , ... , a_n`
    in an `n`-dimensional {{vector space, IEV:102-03-01}}, which is chosen to express
    any vector *`U`* as a unique linear combination of these `n` vectors `U = U_1
    a_1 + U_2 a_2 + ... + U_n a_n`, where `U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n` are scalars

  notes:
  - In an Euclidean or Hermitian vector space, an orthonormal base is generally chosen.
    In the vector space formed by a set of `n-`bit words (see Note 1 to entry in {{IEV
    102-03-01, IEV:102-03-01}}, vector space) a base is the set of `n-`bit words having
    only one non-zero bit.
  - Any vector of a base is called "base vector".
