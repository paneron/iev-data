  definition: value of deceleration `Î³`~e~ obtained by dividing the difference of
    the squares of the initial and final speeds by twice the distance travelled while
    the reduction of speed is taking place `gamma_e = ((V_i^2 - V_t^2))/((2 l))` where
    `l` is the distance between the position of the train or vehicle at the moment
    of the operation of the brake control and its position when the final speed is
    attained; `V`~i~ is the initial speed measured at the moment of operation of the
    control device for the brake; `V`~t~ is the final speed obtained at the end of
    the braking
