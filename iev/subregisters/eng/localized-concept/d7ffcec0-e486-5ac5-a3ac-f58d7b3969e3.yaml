  notes:
  - The tag, also known as an "electronic label", "transponder" or "type plate" is
    made up of an RFID chip attached to an antenna. Transmitting in the kilohertz,
    megahertz and gigahertz ranges, tags are either battery-powered or derive their
    power from the RF waves coming from the reader.
