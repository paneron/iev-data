  definition: two-terminal-pair network for which the sum of instantaneous powers
    at the two-terminal pairs is identically equal to zero and for which the ratio
    of the input voltage and the output voltage has a constant value `K`

  notes:
  - An ideal transformer can be considered as a linear inductive 2-terminal-pair element
    characterized by a singular inductance matrix.
  - 'For an ideal transformer, the input voltage `u`~1~, the output voltage `u`~2~,
    the input current `i`~1~ and the output current `i`~2~ are related by the formula:


    `((u_1))/((u_2)) = - ((i_2))/((i_1)) = K`


    with the usual reference conventions for associated voltages and currents given
    for two-port networks in IEC 60375:2003, Clause 7.'
  - 'Under sinusoidal conditions, the impedance `Z`~1~ seen at the input port is the
    product of the terminating impedance `Z` at the output port by the square of the
    constant `K`:


    `Z`~1~ = `K`^2^`Z`'
  - An ideal transformer is a circuit element that neither stores nor dissipates energy.
    The transformer as a device is defined in IEC 60050-151.
