  notes:
  - In radiocommunication, the term “emission” should not be used in the more general
    sense of radio-frequency emission, i.e. the electromagnetic energy that emanates
    from a source in the form of radio waves. For example, that part of the energy
    from a {{local oscillator, IEV:713-10-06}} transferred to external space is a
    radio-frequency {{radiation, IEV:702-02-06}} and not an emission.
  - The term “emission” is also used for the production of any waves or particles
    (see {{IEV 702-02-03, IEV:702-02-03}}), for a process in radiocommunication (see
    {{IEV 702-02-05, IEV:702-02-05}}), as a synonym for a programme ({{IEV 723-01-02,
    IEV:723-01-02}}) in broadcasting and for {{transmission, IEV:723-01-03}} in broadcasting,
    and for a release into the environment (see {{IEV 904-01-11, IEV:904-01-11}}).
  - In French, the term “{{émission, IEV:702-02-04}}” is also used for the concept
    represented by the English term “{{sending, IEV:702-02-04}}” of a signal.
