  notes:
  - The kilometre (km) is a decimal multiple of the metre (m). The hour (h) is a non-decimal
    integer multiple of the second (s). The light year is a non-integer multiple of
    the metre (in the VIM, only integer multiples are considered).
  - Multiples of a unit are often named by adding a unit prefix to the name of the
    unit.
