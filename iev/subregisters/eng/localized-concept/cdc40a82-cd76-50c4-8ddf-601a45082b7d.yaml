  definition: the apparent decrease of the sum of the gains, expressed in decibels,
    of a transmitting antenna and the associated receiving antenna on a long propagation
    path, when significant scattering effects occur on this path

  notes:
  - The gain degradation is connected to the radiation characteristics of the antennas
    and to the propagation characteristics along the transmission path.
