  notes:
  - 'The Boltzmann constant relates the average kinetic energy `E` of particles in
    an ideal gas to the thermodynamic temperature `T` of the gas as follows:


    `E = (3)/(2) k T`.'
  - The Boltzmann constant is used in the {{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} to define the {{kelvin,
    IEV:112-02-08}}.
