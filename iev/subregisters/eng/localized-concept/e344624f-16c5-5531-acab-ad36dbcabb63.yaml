  definition: 'scalar, denoted by `U * V`, attributed to any pair of vectors *`U`*
    and *`V`* in a vector space by a given bilinear form, with the following properties:
    * symmetry: `U * V = V * U`, * `U * U > 0` for `U != 0`'

  notes:
  - 'In an `n`-dimensional space with orthonormal base vectors the scalar product
    of two vectors *`U`* and *`V`* is the sum of the products of each coordinate `U_i`
    of the vector *`U`* and the corresponding coordinate `V_i` of the vector *`V`*:


    `U * V = underset(i)( sum ) U_i V_i`'
  - For two complex vectors *`U`* and *`V`* either the scalar product `U * V` or a
    Hermitian product `U * V *` may be used depending on the application.
  - A scalar product can be similarly defined for a pair consisting of a polar vector
    and an axial vector and is then a pseudo-scalar, or for a pair of two axial vectors
    and is then a scalar.
  - The scalar product of two vector quantities is the scalar product of the associated
    unit vectors multiplied by the product of the scalar quantities.
  - The scalar product is denoted by a half-high dot (Â·) between the two symbols representing
    the vectors.
