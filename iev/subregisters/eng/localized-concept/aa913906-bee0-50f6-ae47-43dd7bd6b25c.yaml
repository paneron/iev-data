  notes:
  - 'Three operational modes are generally distinguished:


    *  The ionization chamber mode: corresponding to that range of operating voltages
    over which gas multiplication does not occur. The pulse amplitude is a direct
    measure of the total number of ions produced in the sensitive volume as the result
    of an ionizing event. This is a current measuring ion chamber, not a pulse type.
    *  The proportional counter mode: corresponding to that range of operating voltages
    over which the gas multiplication factor is independent of the primary ionization.
    The pulse amplitude is proportional to the total number of ions produced in the
    sensitive volume as a result of an ionizing event. *  The Geiger-MÃ¼ller mode:
    corresponding to that range of operating voltages over which each ionizing event
    gives rise to an output pulse having an amplitude that is independent of the number
    of ions initially produced in the sensitive volume by that ionizing event.'
