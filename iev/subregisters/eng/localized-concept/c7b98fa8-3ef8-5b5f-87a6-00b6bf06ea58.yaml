  definition: unbiased estimate of the preferred definition in the time domain of
    the short-term stability characteristic of the oscillator output frequency given
    by `sigma_y ^2 ( tau ) tilde= (1)/((M – 1)) sum_((k = 1))^((M – 1)) ((( Y_((k
    + 1)) – Y_k )^2))/(2)` where `Y`~`k`~ are the average fractional frequency fluctuations
    obtained sequentially, with no systematic dead time between measurements; `τ`
    is the sample time over which the measurements are averaged; `M` is the number
    of measurements

  notes:
  - The confidence of the estimate improves as `M` increases.
  - This entry was numbered 561-04-18 in IEC 60050-561:1991.
