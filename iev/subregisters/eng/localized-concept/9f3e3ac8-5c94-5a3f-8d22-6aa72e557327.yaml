  definition: production process of Nb~3~Sn superconducting wires in which a compact
    formed from Nb powder is dipped into a Sn bath to infiltrate the compact with
    Sn

  notes:
  - Area-reducing processes such as wire drawing or rolling are done to produce a
    thin wire. This is followed by heat-treatment to form Nb~3~Sn compounds.
  - A similar process is used for Nb~3~Al superconducting wires.
