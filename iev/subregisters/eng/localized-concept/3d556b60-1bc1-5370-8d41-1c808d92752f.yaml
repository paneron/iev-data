  definition: quotient of the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}} and the
    speed of light in a medium
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The value of the refractive index can depend on the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}},
    polarization, and direction.
  - The refractive index is expressed by `n` = `c`~0~/`c,` where `c`~0~ is the speed
    of light in vacuum and `c` is the speed of light in the medium.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-24-111">complex refractive index</a>.
  - The refractivity is expressed by `n` − 1, where `n` is refractive index.
  - The refractive index has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-101 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
