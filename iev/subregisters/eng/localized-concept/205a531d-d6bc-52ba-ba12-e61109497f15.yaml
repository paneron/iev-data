  notes:
  - 'The photon spherical irradiance can be expressed by


    `E_((p ,o)) = underset((4 pi))( int ) L_p d omega`


    where `Ω` is solid angle and `L`~p~ is photon radiance.'
  - The photon spherical irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one
    per square metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
