  definition: relative change in permittivity due to a change in temperature divided
    by the change in temperature `T C epsilon = ((epsilon_T – epsilon_((ref))))/((epsilon_((ref))
    ( T – T_((ref)) )))` where `ε`~`T`~ is the permittivity at temperature `T`; `ε`~ref~
    is the permittivity at reference temperature `T`~ref~

  notes:
  - The temperature coefficient of permittivity is generally expressed in megakelvins
    to the power minus one (1/MK).
