  definition: ratio between the time period (`t`~1~), in which the output voltage
    is above a specified level, and the time period (`t`~2~), in which the output
    voltage is below the specified level image::/assets/images/parts/561/561-fig17-en.png[]

  notes:
  - The symmetry is expressed in percent of the duration of the full signal period.
  - 'The specified level may be the arithmetic mean between levels `V`~OL~ and `V`~OH~,
    or 50 % of the peak-to-peak amplitude. The ratio is expressed as:


    `((100 t_1))/((t_1 + t_2)) : ((100 t_2))/((t_1 + t_2))`'
