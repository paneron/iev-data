  definition: asymmetric resistive two-terminal element characterized by zero voltage
    between the terminals when the electric current in it is directed from one terminal
    denoted A to the other denoted B and zero electric current when the electric potential
    at terminal A is less than or equal to the potential at terminal B

  notes:
  - 'The functional relation between voltage `u`~AB~ and electric current `i` is:


    `u`~AB~ = 0 when `i` ≥ 0


    `i` = 0 when `u`~AB~ ≤ 0


    where the reference direction for the electric current is from A to B.'
