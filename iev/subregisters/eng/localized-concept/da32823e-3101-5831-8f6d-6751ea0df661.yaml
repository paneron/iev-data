  notes:
  - For `V`&lt; 2.405 step index fibre can only support one mode as is the case for
    singlemode fibre.
  - For `V`&gt; 5, approximately given by, `V` ^2^/2 and (`V` ^2^/2) [g/(g + 2)],
    for step index and power-law profile fibres, respectively, where g is the profile
    parameter, and `V` is the normalized frequency.
