    is Gaussian when measured across a cross-section

  notes:
  - 'When such a beam is circular in cross-section, the amplitude is:


    `Е(r)` = `E` (0) exp [– (`r` / `w`)^2^]


    where `r` is the distance from beam centre and `w` is the radius at which the
    amplitude is 1/e of its value on the axis.'
