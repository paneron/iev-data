  definition: 'the value of a signal element of a uniform multivalue digital signal,
    with the unit of value being so chosen that adjacent values differ by one unit
    according to the following rules: a) for all unbalanced signals, the lowest notional
    value is zero; b) for balanced signals having an even number of permitted discrete
    values, the notional values are symmetrical about, but omit zero; c) for balanced
    signals having an odd number of permitted discrete values, the notional values
    are symmetrical about, and include zero'
