  notes:
  - The pre-arcing `I`^2^`t` is the `I`^2^`t` integral extended over the pre-arcing
    time of the fuse.
  - The operating `I`^2^`t` is the `I`^2^`t` integral extended over the operating
    time of the fuse.
  - The energy in joules liberated in one ohm of resistance in a circuit protected
    by a fuse is equal to the value of the operating `I`^2^`t` expressed in `A`^2^
    â€¢ `s`.
