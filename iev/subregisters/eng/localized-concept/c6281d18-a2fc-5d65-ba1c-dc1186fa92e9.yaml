  definition: quotient of absorbed radiant flux, `Φ`~a~, and incident radiant flux,
    `Φ`~m~ `alpha = ((Phi_a))/((Phi_m))`
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The absorptance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case,
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, `α` + `ρ` + `τ` = 1 except when <a href="IEV845-21-017">polarized
    radiation</a> is observed, where `ρ` is reflectance and `τ` is transmittance.
  - The absorptance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-75 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
