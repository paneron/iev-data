  notes:
  - 'For in-vitro testing, the erythemal irradiance measured by a detector with the
    fabric sample under test in place is compared to the erythemal irradiance measured
    with no fabric present, where the source is typically a solar simulator. This
    is expressed as the quotient of the erythemal irradiance without fabric to the
    erythemal irradiance through fabric:


    `F_((UVP)) = ((int_((290\ nm))^((400\ nm)) E_(lambda) s_((er)) ( lambda ) d lambda))/((int_((290\
    nm))^((400\ nm)) E_(lambda) s_((er)) ( lambda ) tau ( lambda ) d lambda))`


    where `s`~er~(`λ`) is the erythema spectral weighting function, `Eλ` is the spectral
    irradiance, `τ`(`λ`) is the measured spectral transmittance of the item, and `λ`
    is the wavelength.'
  - The ultraviolet hazard spectral weighting function, `S`~UV~(`λ`), has been substituted
    for `s`~er~(`λ`) in special instances. If so used, the ultraviolet protection
    factor, `F`~UVP~, has to be noted as `F`~UVP~ &amp;lsqb;`S`(`λ`)-weighted&amp;rsqb;.
  - The ultraviolet protection factor has unit one.
