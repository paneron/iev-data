  definition: scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the magnetic field
    strength *`H`* is equal to the magnetization *`M`* *`M`* = `κ`*`H`*

  notes:
  - In an isotropic medium the magnetic susceptibility is a scalar, and in an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
  - In some literature, the symbol `χ`~m~ (rather than `κ`) is used for the "magnetic
    susceptibility".
