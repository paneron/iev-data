  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,
    . for `n` quantities `x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n`, by the positive square root of the
    mean value of their squares: `X_q = ( (1)/(n) ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2 )
    )^(1 // 2)` . for a quantity `x` depending on a variable `t`, by the positive
    square root of the mean value of the square of the quantity taken over a given
    interval `( t_0 , t_0 + T )` of the variable: `X_q = ( (1)/(T) int_( t_0)^( t_0
    + T) ( x ( t ) )^2 d t )^(1 // 2)`'

  notes:
  - The root-mean-square value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The root-mean-square value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript q
    to the symbol of the quantity.
  - The abbreviation RMS was formerly denoted as r.m.s. or rms, but these notations
    are now deprecated.
