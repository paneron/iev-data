  definition: 'the fractional change of effective permeability due to a change in
    temperature divided by that change in temperature: `alpha_((mu e)) = (((( mu_e
    ))_(theta) - (( mu_e ))_((ref))))/(((( mu_e ))_((ref)) ( theta - theta_((ref))
    )))` where (`µ`~e~)`θ` and (`µ`~e~)~ref~ are the effective permeabilities at temperatures
    `θ` and `θ`~ref~ respectively'
