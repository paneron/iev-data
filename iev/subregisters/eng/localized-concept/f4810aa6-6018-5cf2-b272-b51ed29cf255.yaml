  definition: '{{signal, IEV:171-01-03}} in which the value of the characteristic
    carrying information is only defined at {{discrete, IEV:171-01-05}} successive
    instants'

  notes:
  - A discretely timed signal is composed of successive elements in time, each element
    having one or more characteristic quantities carrying information, for example
    its duration, its position in time, its waveform, its magnitude.
  - A discretely timed signal can be a {{continuous-value signal, IEV:171-01-09}},
    as a {{sampled signal, IEV:351-41-26}}, or a {{discrete-value signal, IEV:171-01-11}},
    and therefore a {{digital signal, IEV:171-01-13}}.
