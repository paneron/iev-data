    when one intermodulation product has a frequency nearly equal to the intermediate
    frequency of the receiver

  notes:
  - Possible spurious frequencies are mainly the sub-multiples of combination frequencies
    between the local oscillator frequency and the intermediate frequency, and sub-multiples
    of the tuned frequency.
