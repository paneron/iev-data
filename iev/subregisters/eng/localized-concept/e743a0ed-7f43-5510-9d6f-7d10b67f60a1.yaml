  definition: for a capacitive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, quotient
    of the electric charge `q` at A by the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}})
    `u`~AB~ between the terminals `C = (q)/((u_((AB))))` where the sign of the electric
    charge is determined by taking the electric current in the time integral defining
    this charge as positive if its direction is from A to B and negative if its direction
    is from B to A
