  definition: quotient ramp response Δ`v`~ρ~(`t`) divided by the ramp slope `K`~ρ~
    of the ramp function, the quotient described by `r ( t ) = (1)/((K_(rho))) * Delta
    v_(rho) ( t )`

  notes:
  - 'The unit-ramp response may be calculated from the unit-step response by


    `r ( t ) = int_((- oo))^t h ( tau ) d tau`.'
  - The unit-ramp response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit ramp to an input variable.
