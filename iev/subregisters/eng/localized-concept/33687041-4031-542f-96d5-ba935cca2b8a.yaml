  definition: quotient of the radiance per unit emission bandpass, d`λ`, at a specified
    emission wavelength, `λ`, due to photoluminescence from the specimen when irradiated
    at a specified excitation wavelength, `μ`, and the radiance of the perfect reflecting
    diffuser identically irradiated and viewed

  notes:
  - Spectral quantities with a subscript `λ` in their designation indicate differential
    spectral radiometric quantities.
  - When integrated or summed over the spectral bandpass of the instrument, this quantity
    becomes the bandpass-weighted bispectral luminescent radiance factor, `β`~L,~`λ`(`μ`)Δ`λ`.
  - The complete tabular form of bispectral luminescent radiance factor and reflected
    radiance factor data is the Donaldson matrix representation of bispectral radiance
    factor, `D`(`μ`, `λ`). The excitation wavelengths, `μ`, are tabulated in the vertical
    direction, the emission wavelengths, `λ`, in the horizontal direction, the reflected
    radiance factors, `β`~R~(`λ`), appear on the diagonal where the excitation and
    emission (detection) wavelengths are equal, and the array of bandpass-weighted
    bispectral luminescent radiance factor data, `β`~L~`,λ`(`μ`)Δ`λ`, appear on the
    off-diagonals.
  - The bispectral luminescent radiance factor is expressed in nanometre to the power
    minus one (nm^−1^).
