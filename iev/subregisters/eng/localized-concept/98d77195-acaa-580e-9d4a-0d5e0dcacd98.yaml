  definition: 'in a magnetic core operating in the Rayleigh region, the tangent of
    the magnetic loss angle due to hysteresis divided by the product of the peak current
    `î` in, and the square root of the inductance `L` of, the measuring coil: `eta_i
    = ((tan delta_h))/((î sqrt(L)))`'

  notes:
  - 'The relation between the hysteresis material constant `η`~B~ and the hysteresis
    core constant is:


    `eta_i = eta_B sqrt(((mu_0 mu_e^3))/((V_e)))`


    where `μ`~e~ is the effective permeability and `V`~e~ the effective volume.'
