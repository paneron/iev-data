  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing heat conduction, defined by `F
    o = ((lambda t))/((c_p rho l^2)) = ((alpha t))/((l^2))`, where `λ` is thermal
    conductivity, `t` is duration, `c`~`p`~ is specific heat capacity at constant
    pressure, `ρ` is mass density, `l` is a specified length, and `α` is thermal diffusivity
