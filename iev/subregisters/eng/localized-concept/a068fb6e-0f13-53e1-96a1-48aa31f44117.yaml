  notes:
  - The operating characteristics, usually the current-carrying capacity of the superconducting
    wire, tend to improve toward short-sample characteristics.
  - 'Short sample characteristics: the current-carrying capacity of a superconducting
    wire as measured on a short sample usually less than several meters long in a
    background magnetic field transverse to the direction of current flow.'
