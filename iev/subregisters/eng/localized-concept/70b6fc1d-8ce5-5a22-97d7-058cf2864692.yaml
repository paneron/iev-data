  definition: of a substance, for a parallel beam of specified radiation, the quantity
    `μ` in the expression `μ`d`х` for the fraction of a radiation quantity removed
    by attenuation in passing through a thin layer d`x` of that substance. It is a
    function of the energy of the radiation. According as to whether d`x` is expressed
    in terms of length, mass per unit area, moles per unit area, or atoms per unit
    area `μ` is called the linear, mass, molar, or atomic attenuation coefficient
