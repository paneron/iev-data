  notes:
  - The incident and viewing rays, the surface normal and the specular direction all
    lie in a common plane.
  - 'The aspecular angle is calculated as the difference between the viewing direction
    and the specular direction and is understood to be positive when it lies between
    the specular direction and the incident (illuminating) ray (see the figure below).
