  notes:
  - 'The rotation of the magnetic vector potential `*A*`  is the magnetic flux density
    `*B*`:


    *rot*`*A*` = `*B*`'
  - The magnetic vector potential is not unique since any irrotational vector field
    quantity can be added to a given magnetic vector potential without changing its
    rotation. Under static conditions the magnetic vector potential is often chosen
    so that its divergence is zero.
