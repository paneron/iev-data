    needed to produce fusion reactions

  notes:
  - To initiate these reactions the plasma ions need to be brought to temperatures
    of several tens of millions of degrees Celsius.
  - 'In the inertial confinement fusion, the energy deposited by the laser beams in
    the vicinity of: external surface of the target was transported to the centre
    of the target by heat conduction of free electrons of the plasma.'
  - In magnetic confinement fusion, plasma is subjected to heating by the ohmic electric
    current induced by the magnetic field created in the poloidal coils.
  - In either case, these processes do not generally achieve the goal and additional
    heating systems are used.
