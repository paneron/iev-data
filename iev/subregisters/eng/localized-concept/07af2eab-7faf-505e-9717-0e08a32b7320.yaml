  notes:
  - 'For a surface defined by *`r`* = *`f`*(`u`, `v`) where `( u , v ) in U sube R^2`,
    the scalar surface element is given by


    `| ((del f))/((del u)) xx ((del f))/((del v)) | * d u d v`.'
  - 'For a surface defined by the equation `z` = `f`(`x`, `y`), the scalar surface
    element is given by


    `sqrt(1 + ( ((del f))/((del x)) )^2 + ( ((del f))/((del y)) )^2) d x d y`.'
