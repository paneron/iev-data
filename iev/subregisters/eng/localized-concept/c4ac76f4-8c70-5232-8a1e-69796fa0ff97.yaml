  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of forced
    convection and thermal conduction, defined by `P e = ((rho c_p v l))/(lambda)
    = ((v l))/(alpha)`, where `ρ` is mass density, `cp` is specific heat capacity
    at constant pressure, `v` is speed, `l` is a specified length, `λ` is thermal
    conductivity, and `α` is thermal diffusivity

  notes:
  - The Péclet number is the product of the Reynolds number `Re` and the Prandtl number
    `Pr`, thus `Pe` = `Re` ⋅ `Pr`.
