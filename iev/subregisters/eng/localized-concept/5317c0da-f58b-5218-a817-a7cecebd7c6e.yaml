  notes:
  - Such a sequence is sufficient in favourable cases; it cannot suffice in situations
    such as {{blocking, IEV:715-02-15}}, {{faults, IEV:192-04-01}}, etc.
  - At a given point of the network a call attempt is manifested by a single unsuccessful
    {{bid, IEV:715-02-03}}, or a successful bid and all the subsequent identifiable
    activity related to the establishment of a {{connection, IEV:701-03-01}}.
