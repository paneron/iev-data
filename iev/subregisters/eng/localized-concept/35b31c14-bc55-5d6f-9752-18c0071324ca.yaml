  notes:
  - The channel capacity and the transmission rate of the associated {{transmission
    channels, IEV:701-02-01}} between the two points are not necessarily the same
    in the two directions.
  - The term "bidirectional" should not be used to describe the direction of call
    set-ups (which is described by the term "{{both-way, IEV:701-03-21}}").
  - In French, the terms "bilat√©ral" and "bidirectionnel" should not be confused with
    the term "{{duplex, IEV:701-03-17}}".
