  notes:
  - 'For a unitary matrix with elements `Aij`:


    `underset(i)( sum ) A_((i j)) A_(i k)^( * ) = delta_((j k))` and `underset(k)(
    sum ) A_((i k)) A_(j k)^( * ) = delta_((i j))`


    where `delta_((j k))` and `delta_((i j))` are Kronecker deltas.'
  - Any orthogonal matrix with real elements is a unitary matrix.
