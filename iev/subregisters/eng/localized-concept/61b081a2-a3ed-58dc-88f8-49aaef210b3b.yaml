  notes:
  - Transient overvoltages may be immediately followed by temporary overvoltages.
    In such cases the two overvoltages are considered as separate events.
  - IEC 60071-1 defines three types of transient overvoltages, namely slow-front overvoltages,
    fast-front overvoltages and very fast-front overvoltages according to their time
    to peak, tail or total duration, and possible superimposed oscillations.
