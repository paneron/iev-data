  definition: 1. in linear amplitude modulation, the ratio, generally expressed as
    a percentage, of the difference between the maximum and minimum amplitudes of
    the modulated signal to the sum of these amplitudes

  notes:
  - 'If the modulating signal is a symmetrical alternating signal, only one modulation
    factor will exist. If the modulating signal is not a symmetrical alternating signal,
    a value of the modulation factor may be determined for each spectral component
    of the modulating signal.


    2. in angle modulation, the ratio, generally expressed as a percentage, of the
    peak frequency deviation or peak phase deviation produced by a specified modulating
    signal to the maximum deviation specified for the given transmission system'
