  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between, and the sum
    of, the magnetic losses `P`~90~ , measured perpendicular to, and `P`~0~, measured
    parallel to the direction of rolling, the ratio being expressed as a percentage:
    `T = ((P_((90)) - P_0))/((P_((90)) + P_0)) xx 100 %`'
