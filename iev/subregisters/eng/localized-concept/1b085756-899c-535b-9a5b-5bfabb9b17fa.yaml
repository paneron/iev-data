    related to the whole solar spectrum

  notes:
  - 'The total turbidity factor can be expressed by


    `T`~L~ = (`δ`~R~ + `δ`~A~ + `δ`~Z~ + `δ`~W~) / `δ`~R~


    ~


    where~ `δ`~R~ is the optical thickness with respect to Rayleigh scattering at
    the air molecules, and `δ`~A~, `δ`~Z~, `δ`~W~ are the optical thicknesses with
    respect to Mie scattering and absorption at the aerosol particles, to ozone absorption,
    and to water vapour absorption respectively.'
  - The total turbidity factor has unit one.
