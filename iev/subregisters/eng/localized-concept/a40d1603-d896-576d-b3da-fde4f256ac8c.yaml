  definition: length of the path in the atmosphere that is required to attenuate by
    95 % the luminous flux in a collimated beam from a source at a colour temperature
    of 2 700 K

  notes:
  - The value of the attenuation has been chosen so that the meteorological optical
    range provides an approximate measure of the commonly used concept of meteorological
    visibility.
  - 'The meteorological optical range, `v`, is related to the atmospheric transmissivity,
    `T`, assumed to be uniform, by the formula


    `v = d_0 ((log 0,05))/((log T))` or `T = 0,05^(d_0 // v)`


    where `d`~0~ is the length specified in the definition of atmospheric transmissivity.


    These formulae are sometimes written


    `v = ((log 0,05))/((log T))` or `T = 0,05^(1 // v)`


    with `d`~0~ set to unity.'
