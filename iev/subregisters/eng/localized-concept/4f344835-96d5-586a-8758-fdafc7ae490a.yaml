  definition: for a gamma or X-ray emitting nuclide, the quotient of `l^2 (( ((d X))/((d
    t)) ))_(delta)` by `A`, where (d`Х`/d`t`)~`δ`~ is the exposure rate due to photons
    of energy greater than `δ` at a distance `I` from a point source of this nuclide
    having an activity `A` `Gamma_(delta) = ((l^2))/(A) (( ((d X))/((d t)) ))_(delta)`
    A special unit of exposure rate constant is Rm^2^h^−1^Ci^−1^.

  notes:
  - It is assumed that the attenuation in the source and along `I` is negligible.
    In the case of radium, the value of `Γ` is determined for a filter thickness of
    0,5 mm platinum. Moreover, `Γ` is related not to the activity but to the mass
    of ^226^Ra; a special unit is then Rm^2^h^−1^g^−1^.
