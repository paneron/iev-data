  definition: model describing the magnetic flux distribution in a type II superconductor
    in which the flux density gradient is assumed to be equal to `μ`~0~`J`~c~, where
    `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant and `J`~c~ is the critical current density, whenever
    the magnetic flux density is not zero
