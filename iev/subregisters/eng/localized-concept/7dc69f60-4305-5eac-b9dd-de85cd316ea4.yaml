  notes:
  - By extension, the word "gain" may represent the ratio of powers in a given situation
    and in a reference condition; for example the "gain of an antenna".
  - Gain is generally expressed in logarithmic units by a positive or negative value.
    When a gain has a negative value in logarithmic units, attenuation may be used
    instead of gain.
