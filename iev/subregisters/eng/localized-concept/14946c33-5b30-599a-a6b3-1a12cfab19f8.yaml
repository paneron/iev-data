        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  classification: Preferred

  definition: mean value of the {{information content, IEV:171-07-14}} of the events
    in a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events `H = sum_((i
    = 1))^n p ( x_i ) * I ( x_i ) = sum_((i = 1))^n p ( x_i ) * log ( (1)/((p ( x_i
    ))) )` where `X = { x_1 , ... , x_n }` is the set of events `x_i ( i = 1, ...
    , n )`, `I ( x_i )` are their information contents and `p ( x_i )` the probabilities
    of their occurrences, subject to `sum_((i = 1))^n p ( x_i ) = 1`
  examples:
  - Let `{ a , b , c }` be a set of three events and let `p ( a ) = 0,5`, `p ( b )
    = 0,25` and `p ( c ) = 0,25` be the probabilities of their occurrences. The entropy
    of this set is `H ( X ) = p ( a ) * I ( a ) + p ( b ) * I ( b ) + p ( c ) * I
    ( c ) = 1,5 Sh`.
