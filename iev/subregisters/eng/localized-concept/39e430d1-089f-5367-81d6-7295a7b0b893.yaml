  definition: ionospheric propagation at a sufficiently low frequency that, for given
    conditions, trans-ionospheric propagation is not possible; the radio wave is then
    subject to progressive refraction which, when considered from a sufficiently large
    distance may be considered as equivalent to reflection from a hypothetical surface
