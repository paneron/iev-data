  definition: two-port, for which the inverse of the frequency response ({{131-15-21,
    IEV:131-15-21}}) has an argument which is an odd function of frequency and has,
    at every positive frequency, the smallest possible value for a given modulus

  notes:
  - A lumped-element minimum-phase network has a transfer function ({{131-15-20, IEV:131-15-20}}),
    expressed as a function of complex frequency, with no zeros in the right-half
    plane.
