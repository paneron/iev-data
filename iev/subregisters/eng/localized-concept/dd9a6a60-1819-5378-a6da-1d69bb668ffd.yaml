  notes:
  - There are no precise limits for the spectral range of visible radiation since
    they depend upon the amount of radiant flux reaching the retina and the responsivity
    of the observer. The lower limit is generally taken between 360 nm and 400 nm
    and the upper limit between 760 nm and 830 nm.
