  notes:
  - The inhomogeneous field condition of a point-plane electrode configuration is
    the worst case with regard to voltage withstand capability and is referred to
    as case A in IEC 60664-1. It is represented by a point electrode having a 30 μm
    radius and a plane of 1 m × 1 m.
  - For frequencies exceeding 30 kHz, the field is considered to be inhomogeneous
    when the radius of curvature of the conductive parts is less than 20 % of the
    clearance.
