  notes:
  - Conductive materials or objects are neither dissipative nor insulating and are
    incapable of retaining a significant electrostatic charge when in contact with
    the earth.
  - 'Boundary limits for the conductive range for solid materials, enclosures, some
    objects and bulk materials are given in IEC TS 60079-32-1, _Explosive atmospheres
    – Part 32-1: Electrostatic hazards, guidance_.'
  - Product standards and other standards covering electrostatic properties often
    include specific definitions of "conductive", which apply only to items covered
    by those standards and can be different to the definitions given here. See e.g.
    ISO 8031, _Rubber and plastics hoses and hose assemblies – Determination of electrical
    resistance and conductivity_, and ISO 8330, _Rubber and plastics hoses and hose
    assemblies – Vocabulary_, for hose and hose assemblies.
