  definition: virtual magnetic flux in an area surrounded by a loop C `Phi_C = Phi
    + mu_0 lambda^2 underset(C)( int ) J * d l` where `Φ` is the magnetic flux in
    the area, `λ` is the penetration depth, *`J`* is the superconducting current density,
    `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant and d*`l`* is a vector line element.

  notes:
  - The fluxoid in a superconductor is quantized to a multiple of the flux quantum
    `Φ`~0~.
  - The fluxoid is sometimes used instead of the fluxon which exists far from the
    surface of a superconductor.
