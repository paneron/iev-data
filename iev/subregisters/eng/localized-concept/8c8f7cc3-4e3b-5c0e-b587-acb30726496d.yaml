  notes:
  - In dead-end operation, almost 100Â % of the reactant fed to the cell or fuel cell
    stack is consumed. A small fraction of reactants can be vented out from {{fuel
    cell power systems, IEV:485-09-01}}, which requires periodic purging of the {{electrode,
    IEV:485-02-01}} compartment(s).
