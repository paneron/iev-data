  definition: an imaging process in which X-radiation ionizes a high-pressure, high-atomic-weight
    gas in a narrow-gap, parallel-plate ionization chamber. A latent image is produced
    on an insulating film covering one of the plates. After removal of the film the
    image is made visible by applying a fine powder. The process produces pronounced
    edge contrast
