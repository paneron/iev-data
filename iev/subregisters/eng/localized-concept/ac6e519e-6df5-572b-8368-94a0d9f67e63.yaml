    luminous efficiency</a> multiplied by maximum luminous efficacy of a specified
    photometric condition

  notes:
  - 'Luminous energy for photopic vision is expressed by


    `Q_v = K_m int_0^(oo) Q_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `Q`~e,`λ`~(`λ`) is the spectral radiant energy at wavelength `λ`, `V`(`λ`)
    is spectral luminous efficiency, and `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy.'
  - The term "quantity of light" is no longer used.
  - Luminous energy can be emitted, transferred or received.
  - 'Luminous energy can be expressed by the time integral of the luminous flux, `Φ`~v~,
    over a given duration, Δ`t`:


    `Q_v = int_((Delta t)) Phi_v d t`'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant energy". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon energy".
  - The luminous energy is expressed in lumen second (lm·s) or lumen hour (lm·h).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-28 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
