  definition: 'a) in relation to power cables: practice of laying single-core cables
    so that each phase cable successively occupies, over approximately equal lengths
    of the route, each geometrical position in the laying formation b) in relation
    to shielding conductors: practice of laying a shielding conductor alongside an
    elementary section of untransposed power cables so that, in relation to the plane
    of symmetry of the cable laying formation, the conductor over one half of the
    section length occupies one position and over the other half occupies a symmetrically
    opposite position'
