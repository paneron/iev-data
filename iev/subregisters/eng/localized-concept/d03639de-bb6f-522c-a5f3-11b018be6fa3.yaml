  definition: random noise the values of which over any number n of arbitrary instants
    are distributed in accordance with an n-variable gaussian probability law

  notes:
  - Gaussian noise is entirely defined by its time varying mean and by a covariance
    function of two instants. If the noise is stationary the mean is independent of
    time, the covariance becomes a correlation function depending only on the difference
    between the two instants considered and the knowledge of this correlation function
    is equivalent to that of the power spectral density.
  - Gaussian noise may be produced by a large number of independent pulses such that
    in any finite time interval each has a negligible value compared to that of the
    sum of the pulses.
  - In practice thermal noise, shot noise and quantum noise are gaussian noises.
