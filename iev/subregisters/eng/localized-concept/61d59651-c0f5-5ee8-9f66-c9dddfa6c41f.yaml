  definition: 1 – the increase in the cross-section of a beam with increasing distance
    from the source 2 – in the far-field region, angle subtended by two diametrically
    opposed points in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis, at which points the
    irradiance is a specified fraction of the beam's peak irradiance
