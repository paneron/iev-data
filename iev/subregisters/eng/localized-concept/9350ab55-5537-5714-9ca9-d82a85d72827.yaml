  notes:
  - A reference ballast is typically inductive for electric lamps operating on AC
    mains frequencies or resistive for electric lamps operating on high-frequency
    or low-frequency square waves.
  - A reference ballast operated at its rated frequency has a stable voltage/current
    ratio that is relatively uninfluenced by variations in current, temperature and
    magnetic surroundings.
