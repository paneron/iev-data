  notes:
  - The data signalling rate is the minimum value of the binary digit rate strictly
    necessary to convey the same information in the same duration as a given digital
    signal at a given transfer rate.
  - The data signalling rate in parallel transmission is given by `sum_((i = 1))^m
    (1)/((T_i)) (log)_2 n_i`, where `m` is the number of parallel transmission channels,
    `Ti` is the duration of the significant interval for the `i`-th channel, `ni`
    is the number of significant conditions in the `i`-th channel.
  - The unit of data signalling rate is the bit per second (bit/s).
