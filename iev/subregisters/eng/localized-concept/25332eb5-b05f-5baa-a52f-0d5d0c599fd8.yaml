  definition: algebraic or vector representation of the match of two colour stimuli,
    of which, for instance, one can be an additive mixture of three reference colour
    stimuli
  examples:
  - '&amp;lsqb;`C`&amp;rsqb; ≡ `X`&amp;lsqb;X&amp;rsqb; + `Y`&amp;lsqb;Y&amp;rsqb;
    + `Z`&amp;lsqb;Z&amp;rsqb;


    In this equation, the sign "≡" indicates a colour match and is read as "matches".
    The unbracketed symbols represent the amounts of the stimuli indicated by the
    bracketed symbols: thus `R`&amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb; means `R` units of stimulus &amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb;,
    and the sign "+" means an additive mixture of colour stimuli. In such an equation,
    a minus sign means that the stimulus is added to those on the other side of the
    equation when the colour match is made.'

  notes:
  - 'The reference stimuli are represented as &amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb;, &amp;lsqb;G&amp;rsqb;
    and &amp;lsqb;B&amp;rsqb; in which case the sign "≡", read as "matches" should
    be used. As an alternative, the colour equation can be written using boldface
    Roman letters when the equal sign "&amp;equals;", read as "equals" should be used:
    *C* = `X`*X* + `Y`*Y* + `Z`*Z*'
