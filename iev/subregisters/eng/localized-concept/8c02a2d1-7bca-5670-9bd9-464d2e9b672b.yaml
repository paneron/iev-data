  notes:
  - The term “Curie temperature” is also used to characterize a change of phase in
    non-magnetic materials, e.g. in piezoelectric crystals and in piezoceramics. These
    materials lose their piezoelectric behaviour above the Curie temperature, and
    the process is only reversible under specific conditions.
