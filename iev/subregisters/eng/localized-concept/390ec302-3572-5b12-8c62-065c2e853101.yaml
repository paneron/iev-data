    conductors

  notes:
  - A partial discharge may occur inside the insulation or adjacent to a conductor.
  - Scintillations of low energy on the surface of insulating materials are often
    described as partial discharges but should rather be considered as disruptive
    discharges of low energy, since they are the result of local dielectric breakdowns
    of high ionization density, or small arcs, according to the conventions of physics.
