  definition: ratio of the change in electrical {{resistance, IEV:131-12-04}} divided
    by the product of the original resistance (`R`~o~, resistance in the undeformed
    configuration) and the engineering strain (`e`) `G`~F~=(`R`−`R`~o~)/`R`~o~`e`
    where `R` is the electrical resistance in the deformed configuration.
