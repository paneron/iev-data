  notes:
  - Under reactive ion etching, material is removed selectively in the vertical direction
    under the mask by both chemical reaction and physical bombardment (sputtering)
    with ions and radicals produced in plasma. Unlike in anisotropic etching wherein
    the direction of erosion depends on the crystal orientation of the material, in
    reactive ion etching the direction of removal is determined by the direction of
    the ion stream. Reactive ion etching results in less undercut erosion from the
    edge beneath the mask than does wet etching.
