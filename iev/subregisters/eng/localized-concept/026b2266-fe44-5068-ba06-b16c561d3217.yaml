        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  classification: Preferred
  dateAmended: 2019-03-01
  definition: difference between the {{information content, IEV:171-07-14}} `I`(`x`)
    conveyed by the occurrence of an event `x`, and the conditional information content
    `I ( x | y )` conveyed by the occurrence of the same event, given the occurrence
    of another event `y` `T ( x , y ) = I ( x ) - I ( x | y )`

  notes:
  - The two events are particularly a message at the message source of a channel and
    a message at the message sink of the channel.
  - 'The transinformation content can also be expressed as: `T ( x , y ) = I ( x )
    + I ( y ) - I ( x , y )`, where `I`(`y`) is the information content of the event
    `y`. From this follows that it is symmetric in `x` and `y`: `T ( x , y ) = T (
    y , x )`.'
