    base of natural logarithms

  notes:
  - 1 The mean life is the time constant for the decay of particles.
  - 2 Only exponential decays are known. However, for a combination of different kinds
    of particles with different mean life, the decay is not exponential, and the resulting
    mean life varies with time.
