  definition: density of radiant flux with respect to solid angle in a specified direction
    `I_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d omega))` where `Φ`~e~ is the radiant flux emitted in a
    specified direction, and `Ω` is the solid angle containing that direction

  notes:
  - The definition holds strictly only for a <a href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>.
  - 'The distribution of the radiant intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (`ϑ`, `φ`), is used to determine the
    radiant flux, `Φ`~e~, within a certain solid angle, `Ω`, of a source:


    `Phi_e = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_e ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta d phi \ d vartheta`.'
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous intensity". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon intensity".
  - The radiant intensity is expressed in watt per steradian (W·sr^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-30 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
