  notes:
  - 'In the case of a receiver tuned to frequency `f`~0~, many spurious frequencies
    `f`~s~ can be found from the following formulae:


    `f_s = (1)/(m) ( n f_L +- f_I )`


    or


    `f_s = ((f_0))/(h)`


    where


    `f`~L~ is the local oscillator frequency,


    `f`~I~ is the intermediate frequency,


    `m`, `n`, and `h` are integers.'
