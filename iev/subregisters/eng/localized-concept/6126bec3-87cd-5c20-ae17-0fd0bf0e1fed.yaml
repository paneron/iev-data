  definition: quotient of the temperature coefficient of permeability by the permeability
    at temperature `Θ` `alpha_F = ((alpha_(mu)))/((mu_(Theta))) = ((mu_(Theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_(Theta)
    mu_((ref)) ( Theta - Theta_((ref)) )))` or `alpha_F = ((alpha_(mu)))/((mu_(ref)))
    = ((mu_(Theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_(ref)^2 ( Theta - Theta_((ref)) )))` when `µ`~`Θ`~
    and `µ`~ref~ differ insignificantly

  notes:
  - 'The temperature factor of permeability is a material property which enables to
    calculate the temperature coefficient of effective permeability `α`~`µ`e~ by multiplying
    `α`~F~ by `µ`~e~:


    `alpha_((mu e)) = alpha_F * mu_((e^( * )))`'
