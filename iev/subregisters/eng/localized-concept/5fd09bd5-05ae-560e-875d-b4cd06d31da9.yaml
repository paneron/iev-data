  definition: identity resulting from the divergence theorem applied to the vector
    field `f_1 grad f_2 - f_2 grad f_1`, where `f`~1~ and `f`~2~ are two scalar fields
    given at each point of a three-dimensional domain V limited by a closed surface
    S * *`underset(V)( ∭ ) ( f_1 Delta f_2 - f_2 Delta f_1 ) d V = underset(S)( ∯
    ) ( f_1 grad f_2 - f_2 grad f_1 ) * e_n d A` where d`V` is the volume element,
    *`e`*~n~d`A` is the vector surface element and Δ is the Laplacian operator

  notes:
  - The second Green formula is symmetric with respect to `f`~1~ and `f`~2~.
