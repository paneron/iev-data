  definition: mathematical relation between numerical values based on a given quantity
    equation and specified units of measurement
  examples:
  - In the quantity equation for kinetic energy of a particle, `T` = (1/2) `mv`^2^,
    if `m` = 2 kg and `v` = 3 m/s, then {`T`} = (1/2) × 2 × 3^2^ is a numerical value
    equation giving the numerical value 9 of `T` in joules.

  notes:
  - For the quantities `Q`~1~, `Q`~2~ and `Q`~3~ related by the quantity equation
    `Q`~1~ = `ζ` `Q`~2~ `Q`~3~, the numerical value equation is {`Q`~1~} = `ζ` {`Q`~2~}
    {`Q`~3~}, where {`Q`~1~}, {`Q`~2~}, and {`Q`~3~} denote the numerical values of
    `Q`~1~, `Q`~2~, and `Q`~3~, respectively, provided that they are expressed in
    base units or coherent derived units.
