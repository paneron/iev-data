  notes:
  - Normal solar irradiance is not the same as <a href="IEV845-29-133">direct solar
    irradiance</a>, which is measured on a horizontal surface on the Earth, not necessarily
    perpendicular to the direction of irradiation by the Sun.
  - The normal solar irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
