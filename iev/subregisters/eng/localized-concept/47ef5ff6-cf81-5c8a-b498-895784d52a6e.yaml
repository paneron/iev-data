  definition: for a quantity growing or decaying exponentially towards a constant
    value the duration of a time interval, at the end of which the absolute value
    of the difference between that constant value and the value of the variable quantity
    has decreased to e^–1^ times of the absolute value of the difference at the beginning
    of the interval, where e is the base of natural logarithms

  notes:
  - The time constant is the variable quantity `τ` appearing in the function `F (
    t ) = a + b * e^(- (t)/(tau))` describing a time-dependent variable quantity.
  - 'The time constant is the reciprocal of the damping coefficient `δ` (IEC 60027-6,
    _Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 6: Control technology_)
    of a damped oscillation, as well.'
  - In control technology the time constant usually is derived from the step response
    of a first-order lag element as the duration of the time interval, required to
    reach 63,2 % [i.e. (1 – e^–1^)-times] of the steady-state value of the step response.
  - The time constant is the variable quantity `τ` appearing in the expression `F
    ( t ) = a + b * e^(- (t)/(tau)) * f ( t )` of an exponentially damped oscillation,
    where `f`(`t`) is a sinusoidal function.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-24 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
