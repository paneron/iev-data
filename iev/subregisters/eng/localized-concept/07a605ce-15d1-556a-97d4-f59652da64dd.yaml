  definition: 'graphical representation in polar coordinates of the amplitude reflection
    factor `r` for a lossless uniform transmission line with characteristic impedance
    `Z`~0~: `underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) - Z_0))/((underset(_)(Z) + Z_0)) =
    ((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 - 1))/((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 + 1))` in terms of the complex
    impedance `Z` by two families of orthogonal circles on each of which either the
    resistance `R` or the reactance `X` has a constant value, where `Z` = `R` + j`X`
    is the complex impedance in the direction of propagation of the incident wave
    at the point at which the amplitude reflection factor is evaluated'

  notes:
  - The Smith chart may be used with impedances `Z`, admittances `underset(_)(Y) =
    (1)/(underset(_)(Z))`, normalized impedances `(underset(_)(Z))/((Z_0))` or normalized
    admittances `(underset(_)(Y))/((Y_0)) = ((Z_0))/(underset(_)(Z))`
  - The Smith chart is usually restricted to positive values of `R`, in which case
    it is bounded by an outer circle where the magnitude of the amplitude reflection
    factor is unity.
  - The Smith chart allows the conversion by direct reading of the amplitude reflection
    factor into the real and imaginary parts of the impedance or admittance and vice
    versa; the representation also simplifies the transformation of impedance or admittance
    from one point to another on the same transmission line.
