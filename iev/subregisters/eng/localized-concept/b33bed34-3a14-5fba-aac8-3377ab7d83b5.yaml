      relationship:
        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  classification: Preferred
  dateAmended: 2019-03-01
  definition: mean per {{character, IEV:702-05-10}} of the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}}
    for all possible messages from a {{stationary message source, IEV:171-07-09}}
    `H^( ' ) = underset((m -> oo))((lim)) ((H_m))/(m)` where `Hm` is the entropy of
    the set of all sequences of `m` characters from the source

  notes:
  - The character mean entropy can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon per
    character.
  - The limit might not exist if the source were not stationary.
