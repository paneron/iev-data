  notes:
  - 1 Energy follows a law of conservation according to which the total energy of
    an isolated system remains constant.
  - 2 Energy can be manifested in different forms that are mutually transformable
    into each other, either totally or partially, depending on other laws such as
    conservation of momentum or 2^nd^ law of thermodynamics.
  - 3 The energy in a system may be also increased or decreased when it receives or
    produces energy in other forms than work, e.g. heat.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of energy is joule, J. A non-SI unit for use with the SI
    is electronvolt, eV.
  - 5 Specific energy, or energy per mass, is denoted `e` or `w`.
