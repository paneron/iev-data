  definition: simultaneous colour television system using, in baseband, a composite
    colour signal comprising a luminance signal and two chrominance components which
    are transmitted as quadrature amplitude modulation of a subcarrier, and in which,
    on each line, the polarity of one of the chrominance signals is inverted

  notes:
  - In most actual applications of PAL the scanning system uses 625 lines and 50 fields/second.
    The colour signal is transmitted using vestigial sideband amplitude modulation,
    and the sound is transmitted as frequency modulation of a separate radio-frequency
    carrier.
  - PAL is derived from "Phase Alternation Line".
  - There are different versions of PAL, defined in CCIR Report 624.
