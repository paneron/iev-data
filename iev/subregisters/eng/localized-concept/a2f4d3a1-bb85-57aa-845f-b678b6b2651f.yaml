  definition: for a derivative element, quantity equal to the derivative action coefficient,
    if its input and output variables are variable quantities of the same kind

  notes:
  - Then the derivative action time is given by `T`~D~ = `K`~D~, where `K`~D~ is the
    derivative action coefficient.
  - The derivative action time can also be given as the duration of the time interval
    required by a rampwise variation of the input variable of a derivative element
    to reach the value of the stepwise variation of its output variable.
