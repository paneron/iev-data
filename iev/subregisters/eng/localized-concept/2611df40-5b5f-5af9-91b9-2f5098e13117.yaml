  definition: for a vector field *`U`* that is given at each point of a three-dimensional
    domain V limited by a closed surface S having an orientation towards exterior,
    theorem stating that the volume integral over V of the divergence of the field
    *`U`* is equal to the flux of this field through the surface S `underset(V)( ∭
    ) div U d V = underset(S)( ∯ ) U * e_n d A` where d`V` is the volume element and
    *`e`*~n~d`A` is the vector surface element

  notes:
  - The divergence theorem can be generalized to the `n`-dimensional Euclidean space.
  - In electrostatics, the divergence theorem is applied to express that the electric
    flux through a closed surface is equal to the total electric charge in the domain
    enclosed by the surface. It is then called "Gauss law".
