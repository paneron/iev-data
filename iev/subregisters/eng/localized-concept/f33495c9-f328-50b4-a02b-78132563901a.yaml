  definition: vector Δ*`U`* associated at each point of a given space region with
    a vector *`U`*, equal to the gradient of the divergence of the vector field minus
    the rotation of the rotation of this vector field Δ*`U`* = *grad* div *`U`* −
    *rot rot `U`*

  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the three components of the Laplacian of
    a vector field are:


    `((del^2 U_x))/((del x^2)) + ((del^2 U_x))/((del y^2)) + ((del^2 U_x))/((del z^2))
    , ((del^2 U_y))/((del x^2)) + ((del^2 U_y))/((del y^2)) + ((del^2 U_y))/((del
    z^2)) , ((del^2 U_z))/((del x^2)) + ((del^2 U_z))/((del y^2)) + ((del^2 U_z))/((del
    z^2))`.'
  - The Laplacian of the vector field *`U`* is denoted by Δ*`U`* or ∇^2^*`U`*, where
    Δ is the Laplacian operator.
