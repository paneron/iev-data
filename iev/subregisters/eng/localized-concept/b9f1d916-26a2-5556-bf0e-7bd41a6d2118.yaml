  definition: physical constant used to express the magnetic moment of an electron
    `e h`/4` π m` ≈ (9,274 078 ± 0,000 036) x 10^−24^ Am^2^ where `e` is the elementary
    charge, `h` the Planck's constant, and `m` the electron rest mass

  notes:
  - The numerical value quoted is that adopted by the International Union of Pure
    and Applied Physics (IUPAP).
  - The magnetic moment of a free electron due to its spin is approximately equal
    to 1,001`μ`~B~.
