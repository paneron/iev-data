  definition: ratio of recovered heat flow of a {{fuel cell power system, IEV:485-09-01}}
    to the total enthalpy flow supplied to the fuel cell power system

  notes:
  - The supplied total (including reaction enthalpy) enthalpy flow of the {{raw fuel,
    IEV:485-07-01}} should be related to the lower heating value (LHV) for a better
    comparison with other types of energy conversion system.
