  definition: relative change in length due to a change in thermodynamic temperature
    divided by the change in temperature `alpha = ((l_T – l_((ref))))/((l_((ref))
    ( T – T_((ref)) )))` where `l`~`T`~ is the length at temperature `T`; `l`~ref~
    is the length at reference temperature `T`~ref~
