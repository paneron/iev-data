  definition: 'the complex quantity <u>`γ`</u> appearing in the equation: <u>`a`</u>(t)
    = Ae^j(ωt - φ) - `γx`^ where A and <u>`γ`</u> are in principle independent of
    x, where this expression may represent, along a line parallel to the axis O`x`,
    a component `a(t)` of a sinusoidal electromagnetic field at angular frequency
    ω and initial phase φ, especially in the case of guided propagation by means of
    a cylindrical surface parallel to O`x`, or for a uniform plane wave'
