  definition: 'for a capacitive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, derivative
    of the electric charge `q` with respect to the voltage `u`~AB~ ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}})
    between the terminals: image::/assets/images/parts/131/131-12-14en.gif[] where
    the sign of the electric charge is determined by taking the current in the time
    integral defining the electric charge as positive if its direction is from A to
    B and negative in the opposite case'

  notes:
  - For an ideal capacitor, the differential capacitance `C`~d~ is equal to its capacitance
    `C`.
