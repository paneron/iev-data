  definition: for a material point and a given origin point, axial vector quantity
    equal to the vector product of the position vector *`r`* and the momentum *`p`*,
    thus *`L`* = *`r`* × *`p`*

  notes:
  - 1 For a continuous body, angular momentum is equal to the integral *`L`* = ∫ *`r`*
    × `v` d`m` = ∫ (*`r`* × `v`)`ρ` d`V`, where `ρ` is the mass density in an domain
    having quasi-infinitesimal mass d`m` and volume d`V`, position vector *`r`*, and
    velocity *`v`*. For a system of particles, it is equal to the sum of their angular
    momentums.
  - 2 A body with moment of inertia `J`~`z`~ with respect to an axis `z` and rotating
    with angular velocity `ω`~`z`~ round that axis has angular momentum `L`~`z`~ =
    `J`~`z`~`ω`~`z`~.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of angular momentum is kilogram metre squared per second,
    kg·m^2^/s.
