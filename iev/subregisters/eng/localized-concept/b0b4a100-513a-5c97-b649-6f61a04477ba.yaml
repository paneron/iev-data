  definition: two-terminal-pair network for which the sum of instantaneous powers
    at the two-terminal pairs is identically equal to zero and for which the ratio
    of the input voltage to the output electric current has a constant value `R`

  notes:
  - 'For an ideal gyrator, the input voltage `u`~1~, the output voltage `u`~2~, the
    input current `i`~1~ and the output current `i`~2~ are related by the formula:


    `((u_1))/((i_2)) = - ((u_2))/((i_1)) = R`


    with the usual reference conventions for associated voltages and currents given
    for two-port networks in IEC 60375:2003, Clause 7.'
  - 'Under sinusoidal conditions, the impedance `Z`~1~ seen at the input port is the
    product of the terminating admittance `Y` at the output port by the square of
    the constant `R`:


    `Z`~1~ = `R`^2^`Y`'
  - An ideal gyrator is a circuit element that neither stores nor dissipates energy.
    The gyrator as a device is defined in IEC 60050-726.
