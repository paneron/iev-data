  definition: a shaped-beam antenna for which part of its radiation pattern in one
    plane is such that the radiation intensity is proportional to the square of the
    cosecant of the angle measured from a specified direction in the plane

  notes:
  - In radar applications, the plane is vertical and the angle is measured from the
    horizontal so that objects with the same back-scattering cross-section at the
    same altitude give equal response regardless of distance.
