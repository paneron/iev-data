    or a noise, having a continuous spectrum and finite total energy

  notes:
  - The total energy of a signal or noise is by convention proportional to the time
    integral of the square of its instantaneous value. This integral is proportional
    to a physical energy if the characteristic quantity is a field quantity.
  - The energy spectral density of a deterministic signal exists if its representative
    time function is integrable square. It is equal to the squared modulus of the
    Fourier transform of a signal and also equals the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation
    function of the signal.
