  definition: time response of a linear time-invariant system, which initially is
    in steady state `U`~0~, `V`~0~, produced by application of a ramp function Δ`u`~ρ~(`t`)
    = `K`~ρ~·δ(`t`) to one of the input variables, where Δ`v`~ρ~(`t`) = `v`(`t`) –
    `V`~0~ and Δ`u`~ρ~(`t`) = `u`(`t`) – `U`~0~

  notes:
  - The ramp response of a linear time-invariant system is proportional to the time
    integral of its step response.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-22 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
