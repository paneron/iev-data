  definition: 'distribution, defined as the limit of a positive function, equal to
    zero outside a small interval containing the origin, the integral of which remains
    equal to one when this interval tends to zero `delta ( t ) = { [[0],[oo],[0]]
    [[ for t 0],[ for t = 0],[ for t > 0]] with int_((- oo))^((+ oo)) delta ( t )
    d t = 1` SEE: Figure 4a) and IEC 60027-6.'

  notes:
  - 'A distribution assigns a number to any function `f`(`t`), sufficiently smooth
    for `t` = `t`~0~ [see CEI 60050-103:2009, 103-03-05].


    The Dirac impulse does this according to


    `f ( t_0 ) = int_((- oo))^(oo) delta ( t - t_0 ) f ( t ) d t`.'
  - 'Any shape with area 1 may be used for the definition of δ(`t`), e.g. a rectangular
    pulse with width `τ` and height `τ`^–1^, or a triangular pulse, as shown in Figure
    4a), as well as a Gaussian function


    `(1)/((tau * sqrt(pi))) * e^(- ((t^2))/((tau^2)))`.'
  - Any of the shapes mentioned in Note 2 to entry with `τ` much smaller than the
    smallest time constant at work in the system under consideration may be used for
    a technical approximation of the Dirac impulse.
  - In control technology the Dirac function is mainly important for the definition
    of impulses and exclusively used as a function of time. Therefore the term Dirac
    impulse is used and the definition is adapted accordingly.
