    in passing through a thin layer of thickness Δ`x` of a substance divided by this
    thickness

  notes:
  - The attenuation coefficient is primarily energy dependent.
  - Depending on whether Δ`x` is expressed in terms of length, mass per unit area,
    amount of substance or atoms per unit area, `μ` is called the linear, mass, molar,
    or atomic attenuation coefficient.
