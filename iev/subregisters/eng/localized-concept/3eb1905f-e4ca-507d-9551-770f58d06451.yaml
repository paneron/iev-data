  definition: resistance expressed in ohms between two electrodes in contact with
    the surface to be measured

  notes:
  - 'One common configuration (e.g. in IEC 60079-0, _Explosive atmospheres – Part
    0: Equipment – General requirements_) uses parallel electrodes, 100 mm long and
    10 mm apart.'
  - The surface resistance is dependent upon the electrode configuration. The surface
    resistance measured with the example electrode configuration is ten times lower
    than the surface resistivity.
  - Conductive rubber strip electrodes are preferred over silver paint electrodes.
