  notes:
  - This term is used in the "uncertainty" approach.
  - Influence quantities can originate from the measured system, the measuring equipment
    or the environment.
  - As the calibration diagram depends on the influence quantities, in order to assign
    the result of a measurement it is necessary to know whether the relevant influence
    quantities lie within the specified range.
