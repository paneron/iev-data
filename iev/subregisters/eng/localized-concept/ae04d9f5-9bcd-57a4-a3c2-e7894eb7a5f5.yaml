  definition: effect which occurs when an incident high-energy photon is deflected
    from its original path by an interaction with an electron
  examples: []

  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The electron is ejected from its orbital position and the x-ray photon loses energy
    because of the interaction but continues to travel through the material along
    an altered path. Energy and momentum are conserved in this process. The energy
    shift depends on the angle of scattering and not on the nature of the scattering
    medium. Since the scattered photon has less energy, it has a longer wavelength
    than the incident photon.
