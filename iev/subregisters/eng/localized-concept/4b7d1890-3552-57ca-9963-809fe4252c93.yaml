  notes:
  - The term "fault mode and effects analysis" in IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn;
    replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015) is deprecated, since a fault ({{192-04-01, IEV:192-04-01}})
    is a state and cannot logically have a mode, whereas a failure mode ({{192-03-17,
    IEV:192-03-17}}) is a change of state.
