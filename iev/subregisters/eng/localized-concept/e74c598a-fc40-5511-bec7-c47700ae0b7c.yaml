  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the partial gain of a
    given antenna in a specified direction to the maximum absolute gain of a reference
    antenna having the polarization corresponding to that of the partial gain of the
    given antenna

  notes:
  - When the reference antenna has in the same direction, the same polarization as
    that of the given antenna, the relative gain is the ratio of the absolute gains.
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - A lossless half-wave dipole, elementary electric dipole or very short vertical
    monopole are frequently used as reference antennas.
