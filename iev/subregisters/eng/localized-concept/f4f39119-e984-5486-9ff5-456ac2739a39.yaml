  definition: coefficient of heat transfer when heat exchange takes place between
    a body at thermodynamic temperature `T`~s~ and its surroundings that are at a
    reference temperature `T`~r~, thus `h = (phi)/((| T_s - T_r |))`, where `φ` is
    density of heat flow rate

  - The coherent SI unit of surface coefficient of heat transfer is watt per square
    metre kelvin, W/m^2^∙K.
