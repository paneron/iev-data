  definition: quantity obtained by spectrally weighting the spectral radiant exposure
    with the actinic action spectrum `H_((act)) = int int E_((e , lambda)) ( t ) s_((act))
    ( lambda ) d lambda d t` where `E`~e,`λ`~ is the spectral irradiance in W·m^−2^·nm^−1^
    and `s`~act~(`λ`) is the actinic action spectrum normalized to 1 at its maximum

  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which actinic action spectrum is used, as the unit
    is the same for any action spectrum.
  - The actinic dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^)
  - This entry was numbered 845-06-23 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
