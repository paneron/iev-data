  definition: the ratio, usually expressed in decibels, in a radio link, of the radio-frequency
    power input to the terminals of the transmitting antenna, and the resultant radio-frequency
    signal power available at the terminals of the receiving antenna

  notes:
  - The available power is the maximum real power which a source can deliver to a
    load, i.e. the power which would be transferred if the impedances were conjugately
    matched.
  - The system loss excludes losses in feeder lines but includes all losses in radio-frequency
    circuits which are integral parts of the antenna, such as losses in conducting,
    or dielectric radiating elements, antenna loading coil losses, terminating resistor
    losses, and ground losses in the vicinity of the antenna.
