  notes:
  - Within this definition, harmonized standards might have differences in presentation
    and even in substance, e.g. in explanatory notes, guidance on how to fulfil the
    {{requirement, IEV:901-05-05}}s of the standard, preferences for alternatives
    and varieties.
  - '{{Technical regulations, IEV:901-02-11}} can be harmonized like standards. Corresponding
    terms and definitions are obtained by replacing “standards” by “technical regulations”
    in the definitions {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}} to {{IEV 901-06-09, IEV:901-06-09}},
    and “standardizing bodies” by “authorities” in definition {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}}.'
