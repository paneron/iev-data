  definition: of a substance, for a parallel beam of radiation, the quantity `μ`~abs~
    in the expression `μ`~abs~d`х` for the fraction of energy absorbed in passing
    through a thin layer of thickness d`х` of that substance. It is a function of
    the energy of the radiation. According as to whether d`х` is expressed in terms
    of length, mass per unit area, moles per unit area, or atoms per unit area `μ`~abs~
    is called the linear, mass, molar, or atomic absorption coefficient
