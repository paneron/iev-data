  definition: diagram showing gain and phase angle contours of the closed-loop frequency
    response `((G_0))/((1 + G_0))` plotted in the rectangular coordinates of logarithmic
    gain and phase difference of the open-loop frequency response `G`~0~

  notes:
  - '`((G_0))/((1 + G_0))` is the closed-loop frequency response for changes of the
    reference variable in the case that the controlled variable `x` is used as the
    feedback variable `r` directly. The transfer function of the measuring element
    is assumed unity.'
