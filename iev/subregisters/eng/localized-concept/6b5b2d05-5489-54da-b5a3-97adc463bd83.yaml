  notes:
  - A field superimposed on a second larger field (background) can also be taken as
    two adjacent fields.
  - The value of the luminance difference threshold depends on the methodology, luminance,
    and on the viewing conditions, including the state of adaptation.
  - The luminance difference threshold is expressed in candela per square metre (cd·m^−2^ =
    lm·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-02-46 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
