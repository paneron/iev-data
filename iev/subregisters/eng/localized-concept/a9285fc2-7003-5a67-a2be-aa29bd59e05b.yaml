  notes:
  - 'The sun protection factor is usually determined by comparing the dose of ultraviolet
    radiation from a solar simulator (often a xenon lamp) required to produce just-perceptible
    actinic erythema approximately 24 h after exposure in ultraviolet-irradiated human
    volunteers, with and without a standard amount of the sunscreen being present
    (F~MED,f~ and F~MED,i~, respectively) and is calculated as follows:


    `F`~SP~ = `F`~MED,f~ / `F`~MED,i~.'
  - The sun protection factor can also be determined by equivalent in vitro methods.
  - The sun protection factor has unit one.
