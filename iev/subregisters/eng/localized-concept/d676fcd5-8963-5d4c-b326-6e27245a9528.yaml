  notes:
  - 'The solar factor is the sum of two quantities: the radiant transmittance, `τ`~e~,
    of the glazing and the quantity equal to the quotient of the convected and radiated
    heat gain from the glazing into the interior, `Q`~2~, and the solar radiant energy,
    `Q`~1~, incident on the glazing:


    `g` = `τ`~e~ + `Q`~2~ / `Q`~1~'
  - The solar factor has unit one.
