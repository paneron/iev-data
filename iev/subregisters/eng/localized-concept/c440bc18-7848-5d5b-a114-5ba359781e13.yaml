  notes:
  - A receiving antenna can be regarded as a one-port device when viewed from its
    output port.
  - If the impedance of the device has a constant real part at thermodynamic temperature
    `T` and if quantum effects are neglected, the exchangeable noise power spectral
    density due solely to thermal noise of the device is independent of frequency
    and equal to `kT` where `k` is Boltzmann's constant.
