  definition: 'relation between two entities `a` and `b` having the following properties:
    * reflexivity: `a` = `a`, * symmetry: if `a` = `b` then `b` = `a`, * transitivity:
    if `a` = `b` and `b` = `c` then `a` = `c`, where `c` is a third entity, * if `a`
    = `b` and ℛ{`u`} is any statement involving the entity `u`, then ℛ{`a`} is true
    if and only if ℛ{`b`} is true'
