  notes:
  - 'Piezoelectric actuators are classified into the single-plate, bimorph, and stacked
    types, and the popular material is lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The features
    are: 1) quick response, 2) large output force per volume, 3) ease of miniaturization
    because of the simple structure, 4) narrow {{displacement range, IEV:523-03-07}}
    for easier microdisplacement control, and 5) high efficiency of energy conversion.
    Piezoelectric actuators are used for the actuators for {{micromachines, IEV:523-01-03}},
    such as ultrasonic motors, and vibrators. An applied example is a piezoelectric
    actuator for a travelling mechanism, which moves by the resonance vibration of
    a piezoelectric bimorph, and a micropositioner piezoelectric actuator, which amplifies
    the displacements of a stacked piezoelectric {{device, IEV:151-11-20}} by a lever.'
