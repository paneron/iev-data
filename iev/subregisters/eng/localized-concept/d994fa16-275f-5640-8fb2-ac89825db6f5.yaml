  definition: 1 - state of a ferromagnetic material subjected to an external magnetic
    field of such intensity that the induced magnetization cannot be substantially
    increased by further strengthening of that magnetic field 2 - (Deprecated in this
    sense.) state of remanent magnetization which results from having subjected a
    ferromagnetic material to such an external magnetic field. It is more accurately
    called "saturation remanence"
