  definition: detector of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> which utilizes
    the interaction between radiation and matter resulting in the absorption of photons
    and the consequent liberation of electrons from their states, thereby generating
    an electric potential or current, or causing a change in electrical resistance,
    but excluding electrical phenomena caused by temperature changes
