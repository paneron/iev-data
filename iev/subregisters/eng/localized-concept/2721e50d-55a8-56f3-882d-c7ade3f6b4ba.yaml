  notes:
  - 'The magnitude of the degree of coherence is equal to the visibility, V, of the
    fringes of a 2-beam interference experiment:


    `V = ((S_((max)) - S_((min))))/((S_((max)) + S_((min))))`


    where `S`~max~ is the irradiance at a maximum of the interference pattern, and
    `S`~min~ is the irradiance at a minimum.'
  - Optical radiation is considered highly coherent when the degree of coherence exceeds
    0.88, partially coherent for values less than 0.88 and incoherent for values significantly
    less than 0.88.
