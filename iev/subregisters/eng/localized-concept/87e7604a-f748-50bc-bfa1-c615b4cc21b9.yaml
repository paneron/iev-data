  definition: the velocity vector at a point, in a propagation medium, of a signal
    which may be ideally represented by two superimposed sinusoidal waves of equal
    amplitude and slightly different frequencies approaching a common limiting value

  notes:
  - The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the derivative of frequency with
    respect to the reciprocal of the wavelength.
  - In an isotropic medium the group velocity equals the phase velocity if the phase
    constant is a linear function of the angular frequency.
  - Each waveguide mode has its own particular group velocity.
