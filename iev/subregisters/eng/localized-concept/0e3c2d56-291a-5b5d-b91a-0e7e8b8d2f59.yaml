  definition: 'measure of dispersion equal to the sum of the squared deviations from
    the mean value divided by the number of deviations or by that number minus 1,
    depending upon the cases considered: (1) variance of the whole population of `N`
    items: `(1)/(N) sum_((j = 1))^N ( x_j - bar X )^2` (2) variance of the sample
    of `n` observations: `(1)/(n) sum_((j = 1))^n ( x_j - bar X )^2` (3) estimate
    of the variance of the population from a sample: `(1)/((n - 1)) sum_((j = 1))^n
    ( x_j - bar X )^2` where `bar X` is the mean value of the items of observation
    `x_j` considered'
