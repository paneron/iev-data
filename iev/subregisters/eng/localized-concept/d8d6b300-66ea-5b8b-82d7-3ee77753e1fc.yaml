  notes:
  - For a surface defined by `r = f ( u , v )`, where `( u , v ) in U sube R^2`, the
    tangent plane at point *`r`*(`u`~0~, `v`~0~) is defined by the vectors `(( ((del
    f))/((del u)) ))_([[u = u_0],[v = v_0]])` and `(( ((del f))/((del v)) ))_(([[u
    = u_0],[v = v_0]]))` if they are linearly independent.
