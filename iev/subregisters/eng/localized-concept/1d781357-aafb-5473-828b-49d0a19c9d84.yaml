  definition: for two vectors *`U`* and *`V`* in an `n`-dimensional Euclidean space,
    tensor of the second order defined by the bilinear form `f ( X , Y ) = ( U * X
    ) ( V * Y )`, where *`X`* and *`Y`* are any vectors in the same space

  notes:
  - The bilinear form can be represented by `f ( X , Y ) = ( underset(i)( sum ) U_i
    X_i ) ( underset(j)( sum ) V_j Y_j ) = underset((i j))( sum ) U_i V_j X_i Y_j`
    in terms of the coordinates of the vectors. The dyadic product is then the tensor
    with components `T_((i j)) = U_i V_j`.
  - The dyadic product of two vectors is denoted by `U ox V` or `U V`.
