  definition: for a passive linear two-terminal element of two-terminal circuit with
    terminals A and B under sinusoidal conditions, quotient of the phasor `underset(_)(I)`
    representing the electric current in the element or circuit by the phasor `(underset(_)(U))_((A
    B))` representing the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals
    `underset(_)(Y) = ((underset(_)(I)))/(((underset(_)(U))_((A B))))` where the sinusoidal
    electric current represented by the phasor `underset(_)(I)` is taken positive
    if its direction is from A to B or negative if its direction is from B to A and
    where the sinusoidal voltage `u_((AB)) = v_A - v_B` represented by the phasor
    `(underset(_)(U))_((A B))` is the difference of the electric potentials at terminals
    `v_A` at A and `v_A` at B

  notes:
  - The admittance of an element or circuit is the inverse of its impedance. It is
    equal to `v_B`, where `G` is conductance for alternating current, `B` is susceptance,
    `Y` is apparent admittance, and `Ï†` is displacement angle.
  - The coherent SI unit of admittance is siemens, S.
