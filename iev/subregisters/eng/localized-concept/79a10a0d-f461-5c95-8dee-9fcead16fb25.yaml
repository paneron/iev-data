  definition: factor by which the readings of a physical photometer can be multiplied
    in order to correct for the error caused by differences between the relative spectral
    responsivity of the photometer and the <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous
    efficiency</a> for photopic vision, `V`(`λ`), that it is intended to simulate
    when the photometer is used to measure a source having a <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative
    spectral distribution</a> different from that of the source with which the photometer
    was calibrated

  notes:
  - 'Most photometers are designed to simulate the spectral luminous efficiency for
    photopic vision, `V`(`λ`), and are calibrated using a source corresponding to
    <a href="IEV845-23-021">CIE standard illuminant</a> A. For such a photometer,
    the spectral mismatch correction factor can be calculated using the equation:


    `F^( * ) = ((underset(lambda)( int ) S ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda))/((underset(lambda)(
    int ) S ( lambda ) s_((rel)) ( lambda ) d lambda)) ((underset(lambda)( int ) S_A
    ( lambda ) s_((rel)) ( lambda ) d lambda))/((underset(lambda)( int ) S_A ( lambda
    ) V ( lambda ) d lambda))`


    where `s`~rel~(`λ`) is the relative spectral responsivity of the photometer and
    `S`(`λ`) and `S`~A~(`λ`) are the respective relative spectral power distributions
    of the source to be measured and CIE standard illuminant A.'
  - The term "colour correction factor" is no longer used.
  - The term spectral mismatch correction factor can also be applied to other detectors
    whose response is intended to simulate a particular observer function, such as
    actinic radiometers.
  - The spectral mismatch correction factor has unit one.
