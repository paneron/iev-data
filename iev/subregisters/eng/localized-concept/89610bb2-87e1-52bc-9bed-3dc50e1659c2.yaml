  notes:
  - "The French term \"commutateur\" is, strictly, the smallest switching entity having\
    \ a unique designed function due to its control network. In this meaning, a local\
    \ switching entity is defined by a given sequence of digits included in all its\
    \ subscriber numbers. The corresponding English term is \"switching entity\".\
    \ The term \"central\" is sometimes ambiguous because of its\r\ncorrespondence\
    \ either to \"commutateur\", either to \"centre de commutation\"."
