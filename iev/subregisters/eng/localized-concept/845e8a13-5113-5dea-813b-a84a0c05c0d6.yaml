  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the electric constant
    `ε`~0~ and by the electric field strength `*E*` is equal to the electric polarization
    `*P*`: `*P*` = `ε`~0~ `χ` `*E*`'

  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium the electric susceptibility is a scalar; for an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
