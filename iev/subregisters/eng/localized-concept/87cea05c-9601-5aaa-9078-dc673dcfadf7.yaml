  notes:
  - Colour component transfer functions are frequently used to account for the non-linear
    response of a reference device and/or to improve the visual uniformity of a colour
    space.
  - Generally, colour component transfer functions will be non-linear functions such
    as a power-law (i.e. "gamma") function or a logarithmic function. However, in
    some cases a linear colour component transfer function can be used.
  - For more information on "colour channels" see Note 2 to entry to "<a href="IEV845-32-018">colour
    space encoding</a>".
