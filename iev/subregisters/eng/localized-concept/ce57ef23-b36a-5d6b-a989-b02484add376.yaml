  definition: a synchronization signal received at a synchronization node over a synchronization
    link from a particular distant synchronization node, this signal having been derived
    at the distant node, as a locally-derived synchronization signal, from the phase
    relationship between the cyclic timescale generated by its own clock and the cyclic
    timescale of a digital signal received from the node to which the synchronization
    signal is sent
