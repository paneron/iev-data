  definition: 'a normal mode where the subscripts `m` and `n` added to the abbreviations
    ТМ are assigned by observing the cross-sectional variation of the transverse magnetic
    field vector: 1 – In a rectangular waveguide subscripts `m` and `n`, in that order,
    indicate the number of half-period variations of the mainly transverse field vector
    along paths parallel to the wide and narrow walls respectively.'

  notes:
  - 'The reverse notation, where the `m` and `n` paths are parallel to the narrow
    and wide walls respectively is deprecated.


    2 – In a circular waveguide subscript `m` indicates the number of full-period
    variations of the transverse field vector along a circular path concentric with
    the wall, and subscript `n` indicates the number of reversals of the same vector
    along a radial path, plus one'
