  definition: at a given location of a three-phase system, and for a given system
    configuration, ratio of the highest root-mean-square value of line-to-earth power
    frequency voltage on a healthy line conductor during an earth fault affecting
    one or more line conductors at any point on the system, to the root-mean-square
    value of line-to-earth power frequency voltage which would be obtained at the
    given location in the absence of any such earth fault
