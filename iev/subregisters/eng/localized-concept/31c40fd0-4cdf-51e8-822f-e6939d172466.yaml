  definition: 'of a material saturated by a magnetostatic field, the complex permeability
    when it is subjected to a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in the direction
    of, and having an `vec H` -field component perpendicular to, the magnetostatic
    field strength: `underset(_)(mu)_( _|_ ) = ((underset(_)(mu)_r^2 - underset(_)(kappa)_r^2))/(((underset(_)(mu))_r))`
    where `μ`~r~ and `κ`~r~ are components of Polder''s tensor permeability'
