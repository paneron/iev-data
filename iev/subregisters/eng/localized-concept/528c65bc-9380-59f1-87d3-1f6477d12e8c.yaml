  definition: quotient of the detector output, `Y`, and the detector input, `X` `s
    = (Y)/(X)`
  examples: []
  id: 845-25-061
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - If the detector signal is `Y`~0~ in the absence of input, and is `Y`~t~ when there
    is an input `X`, the responsivity is `s = ((Y_t - Y_0))/(X)`.
  - The term "sensitivity" is no longer used.
