  notes:
  - 'The IP address corresponds to a fully qualified domain name. At present, it consists
    of 32 bits and is generally represented by a sequence of four decimal numbers
    (each in the range from 0 to 255), separated by dots. The IP address of a computer
    usually comprises two parts: a part corresponding to the network number of the
    network on which this computer is located, and a part identifying the computer
    within its network. In the new version IPv6 of the Internet Protocol, the IP address
    consists of 128 bits'
  - The Internet Protocol is not limited to the Internet, and may be used on other
    networks.
