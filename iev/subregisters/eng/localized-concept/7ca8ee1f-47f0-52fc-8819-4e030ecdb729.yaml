  definition: quotient impulse response Δ`v`~δ~(`t`) divided by the impulse area `K`~δ~
    of the impulse function, the quotient described by `g ( t ) = (1)/((K_(delta)))
    * Delta v_( delta ) ( t )`

  notes:
  - 'The unit-impulse response `g`(`t`) of a system contains all properties of the
    system and is used to calculate the response Δ`v`(`t`) of the system to any input
    variable Δ`u`(`t`) by the convolution integral


    `Delta v ( t ) = int_((- oo))^(oo) g ( tau ) * Delta u ( t - tau ) d tau`.'
  - 'The systems frequency response `G ( j * omega )` may be calculated by Fourier
    transformation of `g`(`t`):


    `G ( j * omega ) = ℱ { g ( t ) }`.'
  - The unit-impulse response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit impulse to an input variable.
