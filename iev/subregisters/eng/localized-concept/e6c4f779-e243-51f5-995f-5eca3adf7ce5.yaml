  definition: 'in a graphic representation of the relation between the magnetic flux
    density and the magnetic field strength relation in a material, a region near
    the origin within which the flux density can be described by a quadratic function
    of the field strength: `(B)/((mu_0)) = ( mu_i + v hat H ) H +- (v)/(2) ( hat H^2
    - H^2 )` where `B` is the magnetic flux density `µ`~0~ is the magnetic constant
    `µ`~i~ is the initial permeability `H` is the magnetic field strength `hat H`
    is the peak value of `H` and `v` is the Rayleigh hysteresis coefficient'
