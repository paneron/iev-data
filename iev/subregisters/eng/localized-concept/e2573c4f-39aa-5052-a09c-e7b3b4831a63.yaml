  definition: thickness of an imaginary surface layer of an alternating current carrying
    conductor, assumed to carry throughout its cross-section a direct uniform current
    of the same value as the RMS value of the actual current, of the same material
    as the conductor, and dissipating through Joule effect the same heat per unit
    of external surface

  notes:
  - Eddy current density in the surface layer decreases to 1/e of its value at the
    surface.
