    waste water and condensate. EMD ({{electromagnetic disturbance, IEV:161-01-05}})
    – electromagnetic phenomenon that can degrade the performance of a device, equipment
    or system, or adversely affect living or inert matter. EMI ({{electromagnetic
    interference, IEV:161-01-06}}) – degradation in the performance of equipment or
    transmission channel or a system caused by an electromagnetic disturbance. Recovered
    heat – thermal energy that has been recovered for useful purposes. Waste heat
    – thermal energy released and not recovered.'
