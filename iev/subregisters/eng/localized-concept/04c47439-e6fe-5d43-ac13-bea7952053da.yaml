  definition: for a homogeneous isotropic medium of substantially infinite thickness
    limited by a plane surface, the depth at which the electric field of a sinusoidal
    uniform plane wave penetrating the medium and propagating normally to its surface
    is attenuated in the ratio 1/e

  notes:
  - The penetration depth expressed in metres is equal to the reciprocal of the attenuation
    coefficient, expressed in neper per metre, in the medium that the wave penetrates.
