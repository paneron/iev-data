  notes:
  - In phototelegraphy, the transmission resolution is dependent on the dimensions
    and the effective luminance of the finest detail in question.
  - In document facsimile, assuming that the contrast of the finest detail is adequate,
    the transmitted signal must correspond to a nominal black or a nominal white.
