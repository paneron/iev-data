  definition: number of {{supply interruptions, IEV:692-07-01}} experienced by the
    individual customers affected at least once during a time interval, divided by
    the product of the number of affected customers and the duration of that time
    interval

  notes:
  - 'If `N`~NS~ is the number of customers affected and the supply of customer `j`
    is interrupted `n`~`j`~ times during a time interval of duration `T`, then the
    interruption frequency per customer interrupted is given by


    `f_((CI)) = ((sum_j n_j))/((N_(NS) T))`


    When determining `N`~NS~, each customer affected must be counted only once, regardless
    of the number of interruptions experienced during that time interval.'
  - Usually, only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Interruption frequency per customer interrupted can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
  - This entry was numbered 191-27-02 in IEC 60050-191:1990.
