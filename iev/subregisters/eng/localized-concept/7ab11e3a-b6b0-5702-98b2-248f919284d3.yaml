  notes:
  - Any {{conservative field, IEV:102-05-34}} is an irrotational field, but an irrotational
    field is only a conservative field in a simply connected domain, i.e. a domain
    such that any path between two points can be continuously transformed into any
    other path between the same points, staying within the domain.
