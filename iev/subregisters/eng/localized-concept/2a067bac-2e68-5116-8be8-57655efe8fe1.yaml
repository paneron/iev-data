  notes:
  - A resin or other matrix is made conductive by electroless plating, and it is used
    as a cathode to electrodeposit a desired metal thickly and rapidly. The product
    is obtained by releasing the metal from the matrix. The electroforming method
    is used in the manufacture of stampers for compact discs and laser discs because
    the shape and surface roughness of the matrix is precisely replicated.
