  notes:
  - This quantity is expressed in becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m^3^).
  - For a gas it is necessary to indicate the temperature and pressure conditions
    for which the volumetric activity expressed in becquerels per cubic metre is measured.
    For example, under standard temperature and pressure (STP).
