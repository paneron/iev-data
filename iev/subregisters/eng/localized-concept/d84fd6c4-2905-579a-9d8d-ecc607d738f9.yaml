    given point

  notes:
  - When the space orientation is defined by a right-handed trihedron, the direction
    of the vector surface element defines the orientation of the surface at that point
    as being in the anti-clockwise direction for an observer looking in the direction
    opposite to that of the vector.
  - 'For a surface defined by *`r`* = *`f`*(`u`, `v`) where `( u , v ) in U sube R^2`,
    the vector surface element is given by


    `((del f))/((del u)) xx ((del f))/((del v)) * d u d v`.'
  - A vector surface element is preferably designated by `e_n d A` or sometimes by
    `n d A`, where `e_n = n` is a unit vector normal to the surface and d`A` is a
    scalar surface element.
