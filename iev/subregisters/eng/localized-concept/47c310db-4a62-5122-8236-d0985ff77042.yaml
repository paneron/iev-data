  notes:
  - In the case of oil-immersed transformers, these may or may not have a cushion
    of air (or other gas).
  - 'Sealed transformers fall into two categories:


    a) transformers in which the total volume of oil, together with air (or other
    gas), or any combination thereof, remains constant over the temperature range.


    b) transformers in which the total volume of oil, air (or other gas), or any combination
    thereof, varies over the temperature range and this variation is accommodated
    by a sealed flexible container or a flexible membrane.'
