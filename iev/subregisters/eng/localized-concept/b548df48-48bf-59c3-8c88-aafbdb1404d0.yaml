  definition: quotient of the natural (Napierian) logarithm of the reciprocal of the
    spectral internal transmittance, `τ`~i~(`λ`), of a layer of the medium and the
    length, `l`, of the path of a beam of radiation traversing that layer `a_n ( lambda
    ) = - ((ln tau_i ( lambda )))/(l) = ((log tau_i ( lambda )))/(l) ln(10) = ((A_n
    ( lambda )))/(l)` where `A`~n~(`λ`) is Napierian spectral absorbance.

  notes:
  - The Napierian spectral absorption coefficient is expressed in metre to the power
    minus one (m^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-85 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
