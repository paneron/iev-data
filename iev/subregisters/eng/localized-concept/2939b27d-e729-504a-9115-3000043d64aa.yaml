  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,
    . for `n` quantities `x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n`, by the reciprocal of the mean value
    of their reciprocals: `(1)/((X_h)) = (1)/(n) ( (1)/((x_1)) + (1)/((x_2)) + ...
    + (1)/((x_n)) )` if none of the `n` quantities is equal to zero; `X_h = 0` if
    at least one quantity is equal to zero; . for a quantity `x` depending on a variable
    `t`, by the quantity `X_h` defined by the reciprocal of the mean value of the
    reciprocal of the given quantity: `(1)/((X_h)) = (1)/(T) int_( 0)^( T) (1)/((x
    ( t ))) d t` if the value of the integral is finite; `X_h = 0` in other cases'

  notes:
  - The harmonic mean value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The harmonic mean value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript h to
    the symbol of the quantity.
