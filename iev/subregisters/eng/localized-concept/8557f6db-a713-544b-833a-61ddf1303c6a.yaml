  definition: ratio of the product of ion molality `b` and a correction factor `γ`
    to the molality `b`° of the same ion in a standard solution under standardized
    conditions `a` = `bγ` / `b`°

  notes:
  - The correction factor is called activity coefficient and it is determined experimentally.
  - Normally a standard solution is a solution of the ion at a molality of 1 mol/kg
    (exactly). Standardized conditions are normally 1 013,25 hPa and 25 °C.
