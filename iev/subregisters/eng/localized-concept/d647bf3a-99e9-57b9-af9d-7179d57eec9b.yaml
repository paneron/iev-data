  notes:
  - 'Luminous flux is a quantity derived from the radiant flux, `Φ`~e~, by evaluating
    the radiation according to its action upon the <a href="IEV845-21-036">CIE standard
    photometric observer</a>. Luminous flux can be derived from the spectral radiant
    flux distribution by


    `Phi_v = K_m int_0^(oo) Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, `Φ`~e,`λ`~(`λ`) is spectral radiant
    flux, `V`(`λ`) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a> and
    `λ` is wavelength.'
  - 'The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (`ϑ`, `φ`), is used to determine the
    luminous flux, `Φ`~v~, within a certain solid angle, `Ω`, of a source:


    `Phi_v = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_v ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi \ d
    vartheta`.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant flux". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon flux".
  - The luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
