  definition: 'cloudless sky for which the relative luminance distribution is given
    by the luminance gradation function, `φ`(`Z`), which relates the luminance of
    a sky element to its zenith angle, `Z`: `phi ( Z ) = 1 - e^(((- 0,32))/((cos Z)))`
    if `0 <= Z (pi)/(2)`, and `phi ( Z ) = 1` if `Z = (pi)/(2)` (at the horizon)'
