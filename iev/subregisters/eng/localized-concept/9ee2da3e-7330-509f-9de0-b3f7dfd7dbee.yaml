  notes:
  - 'A function `D`(`x`) can be considered as a distribution `D` assigning to a function
    `f`(`x`) the value


    `D ( f ) = int_((- oo))^((+ oo)) D ( x ) f ( x ) d x` if this integral exists.'
  - 'The derivative of a distribution `D` is another distribution `D`â€² defined for
    any function `f`(`x`) by


    `D^( '' ) ( f ) = - D ( d f // d x )`.'
