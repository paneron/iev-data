  notes:
  - The frequency response of a two-port device equals the ratio of the Laplace transforms
    of output and input signals for the purely imaginary values of the complex frequency,
    the variable of Laplace transform. It is then the Fourier transform of the unit
    pulse response of the two-port device.
