  notes:
  - The Dirac function can be considered as the limit of a function, equal to zero
    outside a small interval containing the origin, and the integral of which remains
    equal to unity when this interval tends to zero. See Figure 2, where instead of
    a triangle any other shape with area 1 is possible, too.
  - The Dirac function is the derivative of the unit step function considered as a
    distribution.
  - 'The Dirac function can be defined for any value `x`~0~ of the variable `x`. The
    usual notation is:


    `f ( x_0 ) = int_( - oo)^( + oo) delta ( x - x_0 ) f ( x ) d x`
