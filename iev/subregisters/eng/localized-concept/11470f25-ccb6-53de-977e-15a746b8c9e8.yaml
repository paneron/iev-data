    of the output variables may be calculated from the values of the input variables

  notes:
  - The behaviour of a system with discrete-value input and output variables (for
    example a switching system) may be described completely by an algorithm. For a
    system with continuous-value and continuous-time input and output variables the
    algorithm is given by or derived from the mathematical relationship between the
    input and output variables.
