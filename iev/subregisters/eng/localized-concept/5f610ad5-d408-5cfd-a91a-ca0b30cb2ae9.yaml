  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,
    . for `n` positive quantities `x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n`, by the positive `n`th root
    of their product: `X_g = ( x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n )^(1 // n)` . for a quantity
    `x` depending on a variable `t`, by the quantity `X_g` calculated from the values
    of the quantity `x`(`t`) by the expression `log ((X_g))/((x_((ref)))) = (1)/(T)
    int_( 0)^( T) log ((x ( t )))/((x_((ref)))) d t` where `x_((ref))` is a reference
    value'

  notes:
  - The geometric mean value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The geometric mean value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript g to
    the symbol of the quantity.
