  definition: 'a complex vector `vec underset(_)(K) = vec K^( '' ) + j vec K^( ″ )`
    which characterizes a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave relative to a point in space
    when each of the electromagnetic field vectors can be represented, in a domain
    of space in the neighbourhood of this point, by an expression such as: `vec (underset(_)(V))_i
    = vec underset(_)(V)_((oi)) e^(j ( omega t - vec underset(_)(K) * vec r ))` in
    which: - vectors `vec underset(_)(V)_((oi))`, generally complex, are independent
    of time and practically constant in the domain considered, - `vec underset(_)(K)`
    vector is practically constant in the domain considered, - `ω` is the angular
    frequency, - `t` is time, - `vec r` is the vector joining the origin of coordinates
    to the point of interest in the domain'

  notes:
  - If the wave can be characterized by a wave vector at every point in a domain,
    there exists a wavefront containing the point and orthogonal to the real part
    `vec K^( ' )` of the wave vector. The magnitude of `vec underset(_)(K)` is 2π
    divided by the wavelength.
  - The wave has an elliptical polarization if the imaginary part of each vector `vec
    underset(_)(V)_((oi))` is neither zero nor collinear with its real part; the wave
    has a linear polarization in the other cases.
