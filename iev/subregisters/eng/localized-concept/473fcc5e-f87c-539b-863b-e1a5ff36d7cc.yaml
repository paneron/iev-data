  definition: the greatest angle of incidence for which a wave propagating in a homogeneous
    medium of relatively high refractive index strikes an interface with a medium
    having a lower refractive index, and for which refraction is just possible

  notes:
  - 'When light propagates in a homogeneous medium of relatively high refractive index
    (`n`~high~) onto a planar interface with a homogeneous material of lower index
    (`n`~low~ ), the critical angle is defined by :


    arcsin (`n`~low~ / `n`~high~)'
