  notes:
  - Any relative quantity is of dimension one.
  - 'Examples: relative permittivity, relative permeability, relative density, relative
    resistances and relative reactances in the theory of electric machines.'
  - 'The symbol of a relative quantity is generally deduced from the symbol of the
    original quantity by adding the subscript r. Examples: `ε`~r~, `µ`~r~.'
  - The qualifier "per unit" (p.u.) is sometimes used but is not recommended.
