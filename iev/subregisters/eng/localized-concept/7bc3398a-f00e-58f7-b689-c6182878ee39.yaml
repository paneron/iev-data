  definition: at a given point within a domain of quasi-infinitesimal volume `V`,
    vector quantity equal to the electric dipole moment *`p`* of the substance contained
    within the domain divided by the volume, `V` *`P`* `=` *`p`* `/`*`V`*

  notes:
  - 'The electric polarization *`P`* satisfies the relation


    `D = epsilon_0 E + P`


    where


    *`D`* is the electric flux density;


    *`E`* is the electric field strength;


    `epsilon_0` is the dielectric constant in free space.'
