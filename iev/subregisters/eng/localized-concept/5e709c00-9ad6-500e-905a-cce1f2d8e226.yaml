  definition: 'for a reciprocal electroacoustic transducer, at a specified frequency:
    a) quotient of the voltage sensitivity of the transducer functioning as a receiver
    of sound (e.g. a microphone) by the sensitivity to current of the transducer functioning
    as an emitter of sound; or b) quotient of the current sensitivity of the transducer
    functioning as a receiver of sound (e.g. a microphone) by the sensitivity to voltage
    of the transducer functioning as an emitter of sound'
