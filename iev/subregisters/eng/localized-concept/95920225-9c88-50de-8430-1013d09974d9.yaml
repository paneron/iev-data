  definition: 'for a set of `n` magnetic circuit elements forming a magnetic circuit,
    matrix expressing the magnetic fluxes `Φ`~`i`~ in the elements in terms of the
    current linkages `Ө`~`j`~ of the elements: `( [[Phi_1],[Phi_2],[vdots],[Phi_n]]
    ) = ( [[Lambda_((11)),Lambda_((12)),...,Lambda_((1 n))],[Lambda_((21)),,,vdots],[vdots,,,vdots],[Lambda_((n
    1)),...,...,Lambda_((n n))]] ) * ( [[Theta_1],[Theta_2],[vdots],[Theta_n]] )`'

  notes:
  - A permeance matrix is always symmetric and positive definite.
  - In electromagnetism, the permeance matrix can be defined, for a set of closed
    paths, as the matrix expressing linear relations between the magnetic fluxes through
    the surfaces bounded by the paths and the current linkages in the paths.
