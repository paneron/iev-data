  definition: quantity that correlates with the more or less luminous aspect of a
    star and that is defined by the formula `m` = `m`~o~ âˆ’ 2,5 log~10~(`E`~pb~/`E`~o~)
    where `E`~pb~ is the point brilliance of the star considered, `m`~o~ and `E`~o~
    are constants based on the magnitudes ascribed to certain standard stars

  notes:
  - In addition to the (visual) apparent magnitude defined here, other apparent magnitudes
    (photographic, bolometric, etc.) are defined by the same formula, but where `E`~pb~
    and `E`~o~ are the responses of a detector having a specified spectral responsivity.
  - The apparent magnitude has unit one.
