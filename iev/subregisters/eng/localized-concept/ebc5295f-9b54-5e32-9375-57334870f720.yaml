  definition: spectral internal transmittance of a layer of an absorbing material
    such that the path of the radiation is of dimension length, and under conditions
    in which the boundary of the material has no influence

  notes:
  - The unit of length has to be specified. If a new unit of length is used that is
    `k` times the magnitude of the original one, then the value of `τ`~i,o~(`λ`) will
    change to `tau^( ' )_(i ,o)^() ( lambda ) = tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )^k`.
  - The spectral transmissivity has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-87 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
