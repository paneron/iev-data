  notes:
  - Several coverage areas may be associated with the same space station, for example,
    a satellite with several antenna beams.
  - In the absence of interference the coverage area will be bounded by a contour
    of pre-determined power flux density.
  - The concept of coverage area, as defined here, applies in a simple way only to
    space stations on board satellites which are geostationary.
