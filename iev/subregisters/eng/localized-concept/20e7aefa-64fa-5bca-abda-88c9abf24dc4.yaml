  definition: 'the magneto-ionic component which, at vertical incidence, is reflected
    at the height at which the electron density and the Earth''s magnetic field are
    such that: `f`~p~^2^ = `f` ^2^ -`f f` ~B~ where `f`~p~ is the plasma frequency,
    `f` is the wave frequency, and `f` ~B~ is the electron gyro frequency'

  notes:
  - This component has left-handed or right-handed elliptical polarization depending
    on whether the direction of propagation is at an obtuse or acute angle to the
    Earth's magnetic field vector.
  - When the direction of propagation is perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field
    this component has linear polarization with the electric flux density vector perpendicular
    to the plane defined by the direction of propagation and the magnetic field.
