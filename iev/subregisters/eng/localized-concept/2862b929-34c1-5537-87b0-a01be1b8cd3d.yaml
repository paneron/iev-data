  definition: 'scalar quantity equal to the flux of the electric current density *`J`*
    through a given directed surface S: `I = underset(S)( int ) J * e_n d A` where
    `*e*`~n~d`A` is the vector surface element'

  notes:
  - The electric current through a surface is equal to the limit of the quotient of
    the electric charge transferred through that surface during a time interval by
    the duration of this interval when this duration tends to zero.
  - For charge carriers confined to a surface, the electric current is defined through
    a curve of this surface (see the note to term “lineic electric current”).
