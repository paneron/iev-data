  definition: the transfer of all the spectral components of a signal from one position
    in the frequency spectrum to another, in such a way that the frequency difference
    for each pair of components is preserved as well as their relative amplitude and
    relative phase

  notes:
  - Frequency translation may be accompanied by frequency inversion, in which case
    the sign of the frequency difference between any pair of components is reversed.
  - A composite signal produced by frequency division multiplexing may itself be subjected
    to further frequency translation.
