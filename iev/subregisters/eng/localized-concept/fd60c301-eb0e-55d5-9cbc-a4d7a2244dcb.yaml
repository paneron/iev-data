  definition: switching element the output variable of which reproduces a change in

  notes:
  - The term delay has here another meaning than for continuous transfer elements.
  - Depending on the application, either the switch-on delay time `t`~1~ or the switch-off
    delay time `t`~2~ or both may be used.
  - In many applications the output variable remains at the value 0 if the duration
    of the time interval `t`~0~ during which the input variable has the value 1 is
    shorter than the duration of the switch-on time interval `t`~1~.
