  definition: 'modulus `A`(`t`) of the {{analytic signal, IEV:702-04-52}} corresponding
    to the real signal `f`(`t`), written in the form: `f` (`t`) + j `g` (`t`) = `A`
    (`t`) e^j`φ`(`t`)^'

  notes:
  - When a modulated signal is represented by `E`(`t`)cos[2`πft` + `θ`(`τ`)] in which
    `f` is substantially larger than the highest frequency of any significant spectral
    component of the modulating signal, the envelope is approximately represented
    by the curve `y` = ± `E`(`t`).
