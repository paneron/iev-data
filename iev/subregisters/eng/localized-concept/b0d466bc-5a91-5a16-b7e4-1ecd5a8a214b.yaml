  definition: detectivity, `D`, normalized to take into account two important parameters
    of the detection system, the sensitive area, `A`, of the detector and the measurement
    bandwidth, Δ`f` `D * = D ( A Delta f )^(1 // 2) = Phi_m^(- 1) ( A Delta f )^(1
    // 2)` where `Φ`~m~ is noise equivalent power

  notes:
  - The concept "normalized detectivity" is realistic only if the responsivity and
    noise output of the detector are {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} independent throughout
    the frequency range under consideration and if the noise equivalent input varies
    as the square root of the detector area; this is not always the case.
  - The normalized detectivity is expressed in metre hertz to the power one half per
    watt (m·Hz^1/2^·W^−1^).
