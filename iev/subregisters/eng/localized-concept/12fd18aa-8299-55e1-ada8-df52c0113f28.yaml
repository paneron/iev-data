  notes:
  - 'Given conditions include aspects that affect reliability, such as: mode of operation;
    stress levels; environmental conditions; and maintenance, where applicable.'
  - It is usually assumed that the item is in a state to perform as required at the
    beginning of the time interval.
  - When `t`~1~ = 0 and `t`~2~ = `t`, then `R`(0, `t`) is denoted simply as `R`(`t`)
    and termed the reliability function, or survival function of the item. See IEC
    61703, _Mathematical expressions for reliability, availability, maintainability
    and maintenance support terms_, for more details.
  - See also reliability, &lt;of an item&gt; ({{192-01-24, IEV:192-01-24}}).
