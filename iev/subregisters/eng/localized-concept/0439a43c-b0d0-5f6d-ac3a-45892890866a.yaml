  notes:
  - 'The reduced luminance coefficient can be expressed by the equation


    `r` = `q`(cos `ε`)^3^


    ^


    where^ `q` is the luminance coefficient in steradian to the power minus one (sr^−1^),
    and `ε` is the angle of incidence in degree (°).'
  - The angle of observation, `α`, affects the value of `r`. By convention this angle
    is fixed at 1° for road lighting calculations.
  - The reduced luminance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus
    one (sr^−1^).
