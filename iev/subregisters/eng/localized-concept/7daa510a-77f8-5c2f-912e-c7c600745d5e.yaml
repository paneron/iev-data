  definition: self-organized monolayer of molecules that are adsorbed by chemical
    bonding on a surface due to the specific affinity of the molecule

  notes:
  - In a self-assembled monolayer, molecules are typically bonded to the {{substrate,
    IEV:521-05-28}} strongly with chemical bonding while molecules in Langmuir-Blodgett
    films are bonded weakly with physisorption, such as electrostatic force.
