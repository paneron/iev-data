  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the magnetic constant
    `μ`~0~ and by the magnetic field strength `*H*` is equal to the magnetic polarization
    `*J*`: `*J*` = `μ`~0~ `κ` `*H*`'

  notes:
  - In an isotropic medium the magnetic susceptibility is a scalar; in an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
