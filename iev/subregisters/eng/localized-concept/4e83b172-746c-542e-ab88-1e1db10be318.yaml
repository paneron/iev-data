  definition: 'continuous function, zero for all negative values of the independent
    variable time and increasing proportionally with a slope equal to one for its
    positive values, described by `rho ( t ) = int_((- oo))^t epsilon ( tau ) d tau
    = { [[0, , ,for, ,t,,0],[t, , ,for, ,t,>,0]]`, where `ε`(`t`) is the unit-step
    function SEE: Figure 4b), Figure 4c) and CEI 60050-103:2009, 103-03-03.'
