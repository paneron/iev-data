  definition: level in decibels equal to ten times the logarithm to the base ten of
    the ratio of the backscattering coefficient of the volume to the reference volume
    backscattering coefficient 4π/`r`~0~, where `r`~0~ is the reference distance,
    preferably chosen to be 1 m

  notes:
  - Whatever reference coefficient is used, it shall be specified.
  - The volume scattering differential for a designated direction other than backward
    is similarly defined.
  - Otherwise described, the volume backscattering differential is the backscattered
    sound pressure level that would exist at the reference distance of `r`~0~ from
    the acoustic centre of the volume containing scatterers, minus the sound pressure
    level of a plane wave incident on the scatterers.
  - 'Expressed in letter symbols:


    `N_V = L_((SC)) - L_i = 10 (log)_((10)) ((A_V // V))/((4 pi r_0^2 // V_0)) dB
    = 10 (log)_((10)) (m)/((4 pi // r_0)) dB`


    where:


    `N`~`V`~  is volume backscattering differential or volume scattering strength


    `L`~SC~  is backscattered sound pressure level at reference distance


    `L`~i~  is incident sound pressure level


    `A`~`V`~  is backscattering cross-section of scatterers in volume `V`


    `r`~0~  is reference distance


    `V_0 = r_0^3` is reference volume


    `m` = `A`~`V`~ /`V`  is volume backscattering coefficient


    `4 pi // r_0 = 4 pi r_0^2 // V_0` is reference volume backscattering coefficient.'
