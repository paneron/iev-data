  definition: 'the disaccommodation of permeability after magnetic conditioning divided
    by the logarithm (to the base of 10) of the ratio of the time intervals between
    the cessation of that conditioning and the second and first measurement respectively:
    `d = (D)/((lg ((t_2))/((t_1))))` where, in this context, `D` is the disaccommodation
    measured over the interval between `t`~1~ and `t`~2~ after magnetic conditioning'
