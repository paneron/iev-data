  definition: for a two-terminal element or a two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, product of the voltage `u_((AB))` between the terminals and the electric
    current `i` in the element or circuit `p = u_((AB)) * i` where `u_((AB))` is the
    line integral of the electric field strength from A to B, and where the electric
    current in the element or circuit is taken positive if its direction is from A
    to B and negative if its direction is from B to A

  notes:
  - The direction of electric current is as defined in {{131-11-29, IEV:131-11-29}}.
  - In circuit theory the electric field strength is generally irrotational and thus
    `u_((AB)) = v_A - v_B`, where `v_A` and `v_B` are the electric potentials at terminals
    A and B, respectively.
  - The coherent SI unit of instantaneous power is watt, W.
