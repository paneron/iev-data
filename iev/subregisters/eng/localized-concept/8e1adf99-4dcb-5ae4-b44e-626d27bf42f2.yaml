  definition: set of `m` interrelated sinusoidal integral quantities of the same kind,
    where `m` is an integer greater than one, all quantities having the same period
    but usually different phases

  notes:
  - In some cases the phases differ by an integral multiple, including zero, of 2`Ï€`
    .
  - Polyphase systems of voltages, electric currents and linked fluxes are commonly
    used.
  - The qualifiers two-phase, three-phase, four-phase, six-phase and twelve-phase
    are used for `m` = 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, respectively.
  - The concept of polyphase system can, under certain conditions, be extended to
    non-sinusoidal periodic quantities.
