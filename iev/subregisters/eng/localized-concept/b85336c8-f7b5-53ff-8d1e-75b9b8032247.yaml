  notes:
  - 'Radiant energy can be expressed by the time integral of radiant flux, `Φ`~e~,
    over a given duration, Δ`t`:


    `Q_e = int_((Delta t)) Phi_e d t`'
  - Radiant energy is expressed as a function of wavelength, `λ`, as a function of
    {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}, `ν`, or as a function of <a href="IEV845-21-026">wavenumber</a>,
    `σ`.
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "<a href="IEV845-21-037">luminous energy</a>".
    The corresponding quantity for photons is "photon energy".
  - The radiant energy is expressed in joule (J = W·s).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-27 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
