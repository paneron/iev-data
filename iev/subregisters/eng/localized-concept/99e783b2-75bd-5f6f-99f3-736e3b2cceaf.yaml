  definition: '{{quantity, IEV:112-01-01}} represented by a single {{scalar, IEV:102-02-18}}
    which depends on the choice of a unit of measurement or on a reference to a measurement
    procedure'

  notes:
  - 'In the usual three-dimensional space, a scalar quantity is independent of {{direction,
    IEV:102-03-12}} and of the choice of the coordinate frame. Examples are: mass,
    electric charge, thermodynamic temperature, Rockwell C hardness, Engler viscosity
    for transformer oil.'
  - The concept of absolute value applies to real scalar quantities, the concepts
    of real part, imaginary part, modulus and argument apply to complex scalar quantities,
    and the concept of square root applies to both.
