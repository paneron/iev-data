  notes:
  - 'An `n`-dimensional vector is represented by an ordered set of `n` scalars, usually
    real or complex numbers, which depend on the choice of the base. In matrix notation,
    these scalars are usually represented as a column matrix:


    `U = ( [[U_1],[U_2],[vdots],[U_n]] )`'
  - A vector in a Euclidean space is characterized by its {{magnitude, IEV:102-03-23}}
    and, if it is a non-zero vector, by its {{direction, IEV:102-03-12}}.
  - "A complex vector *`U`* is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: \n`U\
    \ = A + j B` where *`A`* and *`B`* are real vectors."
  - 'A vector is indicated by a letter symbol in sloped boldface type or by an arrow
    above a sloped lightface letter symbol: *`U`* or `vec U`. The vector *`U`* with
    components `U_i` can be denoted `( U_i )`.'
  - The term "vector" is also used for a {{vector quantity, IEV:102-03-21}}.
  - In geometry, the term “vector” is often used for a directed line segment in a
    {{point space, IEV:102-03-02}}.
