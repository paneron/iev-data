  notes:
  - 'The SI unit of dose equivalent rate is joule per kilogram second, whose special
    name is sievert per second; sub-multiples, such as μSv • h^−1^ , are used in practice.
    The earlier special unit of dose equivalent rate, still in temporary use, was
    rem per second (or its submultiples).


    1 Sv • s^−1^ = 100 rem • s^−1^ = 1 J • kg^−1^ • s^−1^'
