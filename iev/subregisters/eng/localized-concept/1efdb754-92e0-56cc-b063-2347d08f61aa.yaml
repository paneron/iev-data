  notes:
  - 1 Atoms in a chemical element may differ by their neutron numbers, i.e. being
    different isotopes, e.g. hydrogen and deuterium.
  - 2 Substances constituted of the same chemical element may differ by their structure,
    e.g. graphite, diamond, and fullerene, or oxygen O~2~ and ozone O~3~.
  - 3 A chemical element cannot be transformed into another chemical element by chemical
    processes.
