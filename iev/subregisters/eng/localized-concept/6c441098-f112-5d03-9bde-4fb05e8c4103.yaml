  definition: two modes for which the total power crossing any transverse cross-section
    is equal to the total flux, through that cross-section, of the sum of the individual
    Poynting vectors of the modes; in other terms, the total flux across that cross-section,
    of the sum of the two cross-products `vec E_1 xx vec H_2 + vec E_2 xx vec H_1`
    in the total Poynting vector, is zero
