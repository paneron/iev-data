  definition: of an electroacoustic transducer for sound emission, for a specified

    from the effective acoustic centre, and in a specified direction, by the signal
    voltage applied at the input terminals

  notes:
  - When the effective acoustic centre of the transducer cannot be easily determined,
    the distance is measured from the reference point of the transducer.
