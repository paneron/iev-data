  notes:
  - If the final controlling element is mechanically actuated, an additional actuator
    (positioner) is used in some cases.
  - The output variable of the final controlling equipment is usually not free from
    feedback. The interface between the actuator and the final controlling element
    should therefore be selected in such a way that the manipulated variable is not
    affected by feedback from the final controlling element.
