  definition: '`delta ( epsilon ) = - ln ((Phi^( '' )_e))/((Phi_e))` where `Φ`~e~
    is the radiant flux of a collimated beam entering the upper limit layers of the
    atmosphere at an angle `ε` to the vertical, and `Phi^( '' )_e` is the attenuated
    radiant flux of that beam reaching the surface of the Earth'
