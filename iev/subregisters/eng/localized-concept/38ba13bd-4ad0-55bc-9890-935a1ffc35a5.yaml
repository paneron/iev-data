  definition: 'pertaining to an operating characteristic, a device, an electrical
    network or a transmission medium satisfying the superposition principle according
    to which, within a specified working range: - at a specified output port, the
    signal resulting from an arbitrary input signal applied to a given port is such
    that, when the input signal is increased by a numerical factor, the output signal
    is also increased by the same factor. - at a specified output port, the total
    signal resulting from the simultaneous application of a number of arbitrary input
    signals, either individually to given independent ports or collectively into one
    given port, is the sum of individual outputs which would be produced by the application
    to the same input ports of the same input signals, each acting separately'

  - A device with several ports may be linear only for a certain set of ports.
