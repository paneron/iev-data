  definition: complex quantity `underset(_)(gamma) = alpha + j beta` appearing in
    the complex representation of a wave `A_0 exp ( - underset(_)(gamma) x + j omega
    t + j vartheta_0 )`, where its real part `A_0 exp ( - alpha x ) cos ( - beta x
    + omega t + vartheta_0 )` represents, along a line parallel to the `x`-axis, a
    characteristic quantity of a guided sinusoidal wave or a plane sinusoidal wave,
    at angular frequency `Ï‰` and initial phase `vartheta_0`

  notes:
  - The concept of propagation coefficient has a meaning only when `A_0` and `underset(_)(gamma)`
    are substantially independent of `x.`
  - The propagation coefficient has the dimension of reciprocal length and is usually
    a function of frequency.
