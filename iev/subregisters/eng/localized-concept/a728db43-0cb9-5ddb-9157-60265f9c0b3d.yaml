    the image

  notes:
  - An image colour appearance model can be applied to the elements of a scene, an
    original, or a reproduction. It determines perceptual attribute correlates for
    these elements without consideration of the characteristics of any potential medium
    for subsequent reproduction. However, an image colour appearance model followed
    by its inverse can be appropriate for use as a colour reproduction model, especially
    if the reproduction medium does not impose any limitations on the colours to be
    reproduced in the image.
  - There is no general consensus on the appropriate form for an image colour appearance
    model. A single-stimulus colour appearance model cannot be expected to deal completely
    with the effect of changing viewing conditions in an image because the combined
    effect of macroscopic viewing conditions and other colours in the image could
    result in the appearance of any colour in the image changing in a way that is
    not predictable by the single-stimulus model, since it is not keeping track of
    the other colours.
