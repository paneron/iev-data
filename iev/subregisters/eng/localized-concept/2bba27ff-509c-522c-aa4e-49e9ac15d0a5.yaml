  notes:
  - "The signal-to-interference ratio\r\nis generally expressed in {{decibels, IEV:702-07-02}}."
  - "The specified conditions comprise among others:\r\n \r\n* the nature and characteristics\
    \ of the wanted signal, \r\n* the nature and characteristics of the interfering\
    \ signals and the noise,\r\n* the characteristics of the receiver, such as the\
