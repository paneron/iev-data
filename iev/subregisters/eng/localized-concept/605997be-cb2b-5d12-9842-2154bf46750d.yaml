  definition: 'at a point fixed in a medium with a temperature field, scalar quantity
    `λ` characterizing the ability of the medium to transmit heat through a surface
    element containing that point: *`φ`* = −`λ` *grad* `T`, where *`φ`* is the density
    of heat flow rate and `T` is thermodynamic temperature'

  - 1 In an anisotropic medium, thermal conductivity is a tensor quantity.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of thermal conductivity is watt per metre kelvin, W/(m·K).
