  definition: the quotient of d`E` by the product of `ρ` and d`l` where d`E` is the
    energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy in traversing a path length
    d`l` in a material of density `ρ` `(S)/(rho) = (1)/(rho) ((d E))/((d l))`

  notes:
  - For energies at which nuclear interaction can be neglected, the total mass stopping
    power is the sum of the collision mass stopping power and the radiative mass stopping
    power.
