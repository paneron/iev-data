  - IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015) identified
    the term “entity” as an English synonym, which is not true for all applications.
  - The definition for item in IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC
    60050-192:2015) is a description rather than a definition. This new definition

    definition form new note 1.
