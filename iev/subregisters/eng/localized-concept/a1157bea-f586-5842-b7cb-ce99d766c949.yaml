  notes:
  - 'When impedances can be defined, the return loss is given by the formula:


    `- 20 lg | r | = 20 lg | ((underset(_)(Z) - underset(_)(Z)^( '' )))/((underset(_)(Z)
    + underset(_)(Z)^( '' ))) |`


    where `Z` is the characteristic impedance of a transmission line ahead of a discontinuity,
    or the impedance of a source, and `Z`â€² is the impedance after the discontinuity
    or the load impedance seen from the junction between the source and the load.'
