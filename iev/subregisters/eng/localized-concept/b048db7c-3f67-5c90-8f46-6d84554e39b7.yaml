  definition: for two sinusoidal quantities of the same frequency in a given order,
    difference between their initial phases with possible addition of a multiple of

  notes:
  - For the quantities `a^( ' ) ( t ) = hat A^( ' ) cos ( omega t + vartheta^( ' )_0
    )` and `a^( ″ ) ( t ) = hat A^( ″ ) cos ( omega t + vartheta^( ″ )_0 )`, the phase
    difference is `varphi = vartheta^( ″ )_0 - vartheta^( ' )_0 + 2 pi n`, where `n`
    is an integer, chosen so that `- pi varphi &lt;= pi`.
