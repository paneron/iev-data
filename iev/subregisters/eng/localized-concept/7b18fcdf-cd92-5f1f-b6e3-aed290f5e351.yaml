  notes:
  - The term "topic", i.e. product, process or service, has been adopted to encompass
    the subject of standardization in a broad sense, and should be understood equally
    to cover, for example, any material, component, equipment, system, interface,
    protocol, procedure, function, method or activity.
  - '{{Standardization, IEV:901-01-01}} may be limited to particular aspects of any
    subject. For example, in the case of shoes, criteria could be standardized separately
    for sizes and durability.'
