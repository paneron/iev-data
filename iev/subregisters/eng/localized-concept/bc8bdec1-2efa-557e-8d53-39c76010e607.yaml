  definition: for an ordered set of `n` vectors in an `n`-dimensional space with a
    given base, scalar attributed to this set by the unique multilinear form taking
    the value 0 when the vectors are linearly dependent and the value 1 for the base
    vectors

  notes:
  - 'When the coordinates of the `n` vectors `U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n` are arranged
    as columns or rows of an `n xx n` matrix, the determinant of the vectors is equal
    to the determinant of the matrix:


    `det ( U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n ) = | [[U_((11)),U_((12)),cdots,U_((1 n))],[U_((21)),U_((22)),cdots,U_((2
    n))],[vdots,vdots,ddots,vdots],[U_((n 1)),U_((n 2)),cdots,U_((n n))]] |`'
  - According to the sign of the determinant, the set of vectors and the given base
    have the same orientation or opposite orientations.
  - For the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the determinant of three vectors is
    the scalar triple product of the vectors.
