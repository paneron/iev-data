  definition: 1. the direction of the electric field strength vector, if this direction
    is constant in a transverse cross-section of a waveguide 2. the direction of the
    electric field strength vector of a mode at, or close to the intersection of two
    axes of symmetry, if these axes are the only axes of symmetry at right angles
    of the mode in any transverse cross-section
