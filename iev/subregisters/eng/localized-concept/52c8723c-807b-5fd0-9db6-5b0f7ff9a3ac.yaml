  definition: density of photon flux with respect to solid angle in a specified direction
    `I_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d omega))` where `Φ`~p~ is the photon flux emitted in the
    given direction, and `Ω` is the solid angle containing that direction

  notes:
  - 'The distribution of the photon intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (`ϑ`, `φ`), is used to determine the
    photon flux, `Φ`~p~, within a certain solid angle, `Ω`, of a source:


    `Phi_p = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_p ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi \ d
    vartheta`.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant intensity". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "luminous intensity".
  - The photon intensity is expressed in second to the power minus one times steradian
    to the power minus one (s^−1^·sr^−1^).
