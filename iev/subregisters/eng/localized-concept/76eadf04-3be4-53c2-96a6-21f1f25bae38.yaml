    the frequency to which all other components are referred and which is not the
    fundamental component

  notes:
  - If it is clearly stated in a context that the reference fundamental component
    is used, the word “reference” may be omitted, but this standard does not recommend
    such practice.
  - For practical analysis, an approximation of the periodicity may be necessary.
  - In power electronics often the component having the frequency of the AC supply
    system or of the converter output quantities is chosen as reference fundamental
    component.
