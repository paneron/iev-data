  definition: 'a method of justification in which the digit time-slots used to convey
    a digital signal have a digit rate that is always lower than the digit rate of
    the original signal, and in which at each justification instant, depending on
    the prevailing conditions, either: a) one digit of the original signal is transmitted
    in the justifiable digit time-slot, or b) two digits of the original signal are
    transmitted, one in the justifiable digit time-slot with the other digit being
    removed and then transmitted by another means, with these alternative justification
    states being indicated by unique signals formed from justification service digits'
