  notes:
  - Any state of matter, such as solid, liquid, or gas, constitutes always a phase
    separate from other states of matter. Under usual condition, a gas is in one phase
    only. Non-mixable liquid components are in different phases. Different solid phases
    are associated with different structures, e.g. diamond and graphite, or paramagnetic
    and ferromagnetic materials.
