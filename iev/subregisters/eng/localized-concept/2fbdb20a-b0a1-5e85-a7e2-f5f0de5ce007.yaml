  definition: time `τ` in the expression `F ( t ) = A + B e^(- t // tau)` of a quantity
    `F` growing or decaying exponentially towards a constant value `A` with increasing
    time `t`, or in the expression `F ( t ) = A + f ( t ) e^(- t // tau)` of an exponentially
    damped oscillation, where `f` is a periodic function of time

  notes:
  - The time constant of an exponentially varying quantity is the duration of a time
    interval at the end of which the absolute value of the difference between the
    quantity and the limit has decreased to 1/e of the absolute value of this difference
    at the beginning of the time interval, where e is the base of natural logarithms.
  - The time constant of a damped oscillation is the inverse of the damping coefficient.
