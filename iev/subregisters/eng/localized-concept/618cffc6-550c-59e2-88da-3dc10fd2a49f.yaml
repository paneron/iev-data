  definition: 'distortion of voltage waveform caused by a non-linear relation between
    the magnetic flux density and the magnetic field strength in the magnetic core
    and expressed in decibels by: `THD` = 20 lg(`V`~m~/`V`~f~) dB where `V_m = sqrt(sum_((n
    = 1))^(oo) V_n^2)` `V`~`n`~ is the amplitude of the `n`-th harmonic component
    of the waveform and `V`~f~ is the amplitude of its fundamental component'
