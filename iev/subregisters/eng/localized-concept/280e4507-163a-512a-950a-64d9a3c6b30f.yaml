  notes:
  - MEMS technology is often used for typical energy conversion devices. Examples
    of energy derived from environmental sources are solar energy, thermal energy,
    wind energy and mechanical vibration energy. Typical storage devices are a {{capacitor,
    IEV:151-13-28}}, super capacitor, and battery. The important applications for
    energy harvesting are environmental monitoring systems in wide or remote areas,
    security systems, building maintenance systems, and factory maintenance systems.
