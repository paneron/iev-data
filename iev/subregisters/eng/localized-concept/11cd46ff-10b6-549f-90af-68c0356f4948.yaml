  definition: 'graphical representation in polar coordinates of the amplitude reflection
    factor `r`, for a lossless uniform transmission line with characteristic impedance
    `Z`~0~: `underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) - Z_0))/((underset(_)(Z) + Z_0)) =
    ((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 - 1))/((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 + 1))` in terms of the complex
    impedance `Z` by two families of orthogonal circles on each of which either the
    modulus `Z` or the argument `θ` has a constant value, where `Z` = `Z`/`θ` is the
    complex impedance in the direction of propagation of the incident wave at the
    point at which the amplitude reflection factor is evaluated'

  notes:
  - The `Z`-Theta chart may be used with impedances `Z`, admittances `underset(_)(Y)
    = (1)/(underset(_)(Z))`, normalized impedances `(underset(_)(Z))/((Z_0))` or normalized
    admittances `(underset(_)(Y))/((Y_0)) = ((Z_0))/(underset(_)(Z))`.
  - The `Z`-Theta chart is usually restricted to values of `θ` between `- (pi)/(2)`
    and `+ (pi)/(2)` corresponding to positive values of the real part of `Z` in which
    case it is bounded by an outer circle where the magnitude of the amplitude reflection
    factor is unity.
  - The `Z`-Theta chart has the same properties and applications as those of the Smith
    chart, but the complex impedance `Z` is represented with two families of orthogonal
    circles on each of which either the modulus `Z` either the argument `θ` has a
    constant value instead of the real and imaginary parts `R` and `X` of `Z` used
    for the Smith chart.
