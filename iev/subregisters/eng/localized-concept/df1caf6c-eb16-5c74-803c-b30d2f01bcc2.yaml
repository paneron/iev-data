  definition: optical measurement method where the sample is successively irradiated
    with several-wavelength monochromatic light and both the thickness and the <a
    href="IEV845-04-101">refractive index</a> of the layers can be obtained simultaneously
    from the polarized reflection

  notes:
  - Monochromatic light from a spectroscope is linear-polarized using a polarizer.  Then
    the light is irradiated on the thin film, and the reflected light intensity of
    the polarized components is measured. The thickness and the complex refractive
    index can be calculated from the measurement results.
