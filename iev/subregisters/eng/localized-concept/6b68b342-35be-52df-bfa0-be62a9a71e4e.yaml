  notes:
  - In phototelegraphy, the longitudinal and transverse dimensions of the finest detail
    correspond to those of the picture element.
  - In document facsimile, the longitudinal resolution is determined by the length
    of the line produced by the shortest nominal black or nominal white signal capable
    of actuating the receiver.
