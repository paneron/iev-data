  definition: scalar div *`U`* associated at each point of a given space region with
    a vector *`U`*, equal to the limit of the flux of the vector which emerges from
    a closed surface S, divided by the volume of the interior of the surface when
    all its geometrical dimensions become infinitesimal `div U = underset((V -> 0))((lim))
    (1)/(V) underset(S)( ∯ ) U * e_n d A` where *`e`*~n~d`A` is the vector surface
    element oriented outwards and `V` is the volume

  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the divergence is:


    `div U = ((del U_x))/((del x)) + ((del U_y))/((del y)) + ((del U_z))/((del z))`'
  - The divergence of the vector field *`U`* is denoted div *`U`* or *∇* ⋅ *`U`*.
