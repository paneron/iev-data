  definition: functional unit that generates the value of its output variable by extracting
    the root of the value of its input variable and multiplying the square root by
    a constant weighting factor according to the formula `v ( t ) = K * sqrt(u ( t
    ))` where<table> <tr> <td>`t`</td> <td>is the time;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> `u`(`t`)</td>
    <td>is the input variable;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>`K`</td> <td>is the weighting factor;</td>
    </tr> <tr> <td> `v`(`t`)</td> <td>is the output variable.</td> </tr> </table>
