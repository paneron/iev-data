  notes:
  - The value of the measurand is considered to be obtained directly even when the
    scale of a measuring instrument has values which are linked to corresponding values
    of the measurand by means of a table or a graph.
  - The method of measurement remains direct even if it is necessary to make supplementary
    measurements to determine the values of influence quantities in order to make
    corrections.
