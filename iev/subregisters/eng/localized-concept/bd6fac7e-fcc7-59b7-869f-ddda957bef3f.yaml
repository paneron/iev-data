  definition: quotient of blue light hazard weighted radiant flux and radiant flux

  notes:
  - The blue light hazard efficiency of radiation, `η`~B~, is related to the blue
    light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation, `K`~B,v~, through `η`~B~ = `K·K`~B,v~,
    where `K` is luminous efficacy of radiation, and to the blue light hazard factor
    of luminous radiation, `α`~B,v~, through `η`~B~ = `V·α`~B,v~, where `V` is luminous
    efficiency of radiation.
  - For some applications it might be necessary to state both blue light hazard efficiency
    of radiation, `η`~B~, and blue light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation, `K`~B,v~.
  - The blue light hazard efficiency of radiation has unit one.
