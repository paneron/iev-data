  notes:
  - This method has been proposed to enrich uranium. It can be used with atoms of
    uranium or molecules of uranium hexafluoride. This method allows obtaining a high
    enrichment, in a single step (5 % for example from natural uranium). It is also
    very selective as it helps to enrich the isotope ^235^U without isotope enrichment
    of ^234^U and ^236^U.
