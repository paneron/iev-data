  definition: set of points of a three-dimensional point space, the position vector
    of which is a continuous function *`f`* of the pairs of real numbers `u` and `v`
    in some region U `r = f ( u , v )` where `( u , v ) in U sube R^2`

  notes:
  - A surface can also be generated by a family of curves dependent on one parameter
    or, in a three-dimensional space, be defined algebraically by the equation `f
    ( x , y , z ) = 0`.
