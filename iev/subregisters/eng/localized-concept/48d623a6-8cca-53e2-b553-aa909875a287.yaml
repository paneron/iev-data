  notes:
  - 'Acceptance angle is a function of position on the entrance face of the core when
    the refractive index is a function of radius in the core. In that case, it is:


    `arcsin n^2 ( r ) - n_2^2^(1 // 2)`


    where `n` (`r`) is the refractive index and `n`~2~ is the minimum refractive index
    of the cladding.'
  - Power may be coupled into leaky modes at angles exceeding the acceptance angle.
