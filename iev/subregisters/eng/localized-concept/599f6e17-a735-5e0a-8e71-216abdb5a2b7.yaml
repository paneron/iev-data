  definition: a) of an electroacoustic transducer for sound emission, at a specified
    frequency, ratio of the square of the free-field sound pressure at a fixed point
    on the principal axis, to the mean-square sound pressure over the surface of a
    sphere concentric with the effective acoustic centre of the transducer, and passing
    through the fixed point b) of an electroacoustic transducer for sound reception,
    at a specified frequency, ratio of the square of the free-field sensitivity to
    sound waves that arrive along the principal axis, to the mean-square sensitivity
    to a succession of sound waves that arrive at the transducer with equal probability
    from all directions
