  definition: pseudo-scalar, denoted by (*`U`*,*`V`*,*`W`*), assigned to an ordered
    set of three vectors *`U`*, *`V`*, *`W`* in the three-dimensional Euclidean space,
    equal to the scalar product `U * ( V xx W )`

  notes:
  - 'The scalar triple product of three vectors *`U`*, *`V`*, *`W`* is the determinant
    of the vectors relative to a given orthonormal base:


    `( U , â€‹ V , W ) = | [[U_1,U_2,U_3],[V_1,V_2,V_3],[W_1,W_2,W_3]] |`'
  - The scalar triple product of three position vectors is the volume of the parallelepiped
    built from the vectors with a sign depending on the space orientation.
