  notes:
  - This concept is normally applied to {{bulk electric systems, IEV:692-01-04}}.
  - In North America, security is usually defined with reference to instability, voltage
    collapse and {{cascade tripping, IEV:692-03-08}} only.
  - See also the related term "fault tolerance" ({{IEV 192-10-09, IEV:192-10-09}}).
