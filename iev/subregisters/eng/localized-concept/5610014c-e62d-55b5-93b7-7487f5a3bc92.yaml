  definition: 'binary relation ℛ between elements `a` and `b` of a given set having
    the following properties: * reflexivity: `a`ℛ`a`*,* * antisymmetry: if `a`ℛ`b`
    and `b`ℛ`a` then `a` = `b`*,* * transitivity: if `a`ℛ`b` and `b`ℛ`c` then `a`ℛ`c`,
    for any elements `a`, `b` and `c` of the given set'

  notes:
  - The given set is said to be ordered by the relation ℛ.
  - An order relation is a total order if at least one of the relations `a`ℛ`b` and
    `b`ℛ`a` is true for any elements `a` and `b`. The usual order for real numbers
    is a total order because `a` ≤ `b` or `b` ≤ `a`.
  - An order relation is a partial order if, for at least two elements `a` and `b`,
    neither `a`ℛ`b` nor `b`ℛ`a` is true. Examples are the divisibility relation for
    natural numbers and the inclusion relation for subsets of a set with at least
    two elements.
