  notes:
  - The surface of cement or of any other non-insulating jointing material is not
    considered as forming part of the creepage distance.
  - If a high resistance coating is applied to parts of the insulating part of an
    insulator, such parts are considered to be effective insulating surfaces and the
    distance over them is included in the creepage distance.
