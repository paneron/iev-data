  definition: 'a) of two-winding transformers: the voltage required to be applied
    at rated frequency to the line terminals of a winding of a polyphase transformer,
    or to the terminals of a winding of a single-phase transformer, to cause the rated
    current to flow through these terminals when the terminals of the other winding
    are short-circuited'

  notes:
  - 'The value is normally related to the appropriate reference temperature.


    b) of multi-winding transformers, related to a certain pair of windings:


    the voltage required to be applied at rated frequency to the line terminals of
    one of the windings of a pair for a polyphase transformer, or to the terminals
    of such a winding for a single-phase transformer, to cause a current to flow through
    these terminals corresponding to the smaller of the rated power values of both
    windings of that pair, the terminals of the other winding of the pair being short-circuited
    and the remaining winding(s) being open-circuited'
  - The various values for the different pairs are normally related to the appropriate
    reference temperature.
  - The impedance voltage at rated current is usually expressed as a percentage of
    the rated voltage of the winding to which the voltage is applied.
