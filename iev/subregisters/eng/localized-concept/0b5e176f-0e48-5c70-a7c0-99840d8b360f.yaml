  definition: quotient of the relative change of saturation magnetic polarization
    due to a change in temperature by that change in temperature `alpha_((J s)) =
    ((J_((s Theta)) - J_((sref))))/((J_((sref)) ( Theta - Theta_((ref)) )))` where
    `J`~s`Θ`~ and `J`~sref~ are the saturation magnetizations at temperatures of `Θ`
    and `Θ`~ref~ respectively
