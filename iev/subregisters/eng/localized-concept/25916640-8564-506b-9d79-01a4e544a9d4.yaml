  definition: the product of the mass energy transfer coefficient `( ((mu_((tr))))/(rho)
    )` for that energy and (1â€“ `g`) where `g` is the fraction of the energy of secondary
    charged particles that is lost to bremsstrahlung in the material

  notes:
  - When the material is air, `((mu_((en))))/(rho)` is proportional to the quotient
    of exposure by energy fluence in the usual case of constant W.
