  definition: vector *grad* `f` associated at each point of a given space region with
    a scalar `f`, having a direction normal to the surface on which the scalar field
    has a constant value, in the sense of increasing value of `f`, and a magnitude
    equal to the absolute value of the derivative of `f` with respect to distance
    in this normal direction

  notes:
  - The gradient expresses the variation of the scalar field quantity from the given
    point to a point at an infinitesimal distance `d s` in the direction of a given
    unit vector *`e`* by the scalar product d`f` = *grad* `f` ⋅ *`e`* d`s`.
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the three coordinates of the gradient are:


    `((del f))/((del x)) , ((del f))/((del y)) , ((del f))/((del z))`.'
  - The gradient of the scalar field `f` is denoted *grad* `f` or `grad f`.
