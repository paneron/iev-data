  notes:
  - 1 Electron gas in semiconductors behaves as normal gas following classical statistics.
    In metals, due to its enormous concentration and low mass of electron, electron
    gas behaves as degenerated gas following Fermi-Dirac statistics.
  - 2 Electron gas is responsible for electric and thermal conductivity of metals.
