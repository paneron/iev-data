  definition: illuminance averaged over a circular aperture of 100 mmÂ² area normal
    to the LED's mechanical axis at a distance of 100 mm for CIE Standard Condition
    A or 316 mm for CIE Standard Condition B from the tip of the LED, multiplied by
    the square of the distance and divided by a unit solid angle
