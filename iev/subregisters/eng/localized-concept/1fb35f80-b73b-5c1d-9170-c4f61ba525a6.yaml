  definition: 'the tensor permeability of a material saturated by a static magnetic
    field that is collinear with the time-varying field, with the direction of the
    static field defining the z-axis: `( [[ underset(_)(mu)_((()_r)),- j (underset(_)(kappa))_r,0],[(underset(_)(underset(_)(mu)))_p
    = j underset(_)(kappa)_r,(underset(_)(mu))_((()_r)),0],[ 0,0,1]] )` where `μ`~r~
    and `κ`~r~ are complex permeabilities'
