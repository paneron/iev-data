  definition: 'the quantity which characterizes the material dispersion defined as:
    `M ( lambda ) = - (1)/((c_0)) ((d N))/((d lambda)) = ((lambda d^2 n))/((c_0 d
    lambda^2))` where `n` is the refractive index, `N` is the group index, `λ` is
    the wavelength in vacuum, and `c`~0~ is the speed of light in vacuum'

  notes:
  - For many optical fibre materials, `M` is zero at a specific wavelength `λ`~0~,
    usually around 1300 nm. The sign convention is such that `M` is positive for wavelengths
    shorter than `λ`~0~ and negative for wavelengths longer than `λ`~0~.
  - Pulse broadening caused by material dispersion in a unit length of optical fibre
    is give by `M` times spectral linewidth (Δ`λ`), except at or near `λ` = `λ`~0~,
    where terms proportional to (Δ`λ`)^2^ are important.
