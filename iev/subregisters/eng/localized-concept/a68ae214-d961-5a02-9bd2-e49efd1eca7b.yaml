    additive scalar quantity equal to the integral `I_a = int_S R^2 d A`, where `R`
    is the distance between a surface element with area d`A` and the axis

  notes:
  - 1 The second axial moment of area is sometimes given the wrong name "moment of
    inertia" but should not to be confused with the quantity "moment of inertia".
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of second axial moment of area is metre to the power four,
    m^4^.
