  definition: identity resulting from the divergence theorem applied to the vector
    field `f_1 grad f_2`, where `f`~1~ and `f`~2~ are two scalar fields given at each
    point of a three-dimensional domain V limited by a closed surface S `underset(V)(
    ∭ ) ( grad f_1 * g r a d f_2 + f_1 Delta f_2 ) d V = underset(S)( ∯ ) f_1 g r
    a d f_2 * e_n d A` where d`V` is the volume element, *`e`*~n~d`A` is the vector
    surface element and Δ is the Laplacian operator

  - In English the first Green formula is sometimes called “first Green theorem” or
    “first Green identity”.
