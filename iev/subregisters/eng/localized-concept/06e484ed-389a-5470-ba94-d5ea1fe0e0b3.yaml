      original: SI Brochure, 9th edition, 2019, 2.2, modified – The full form of the
        term, including the adjective "electric", has been specified as the preferred
        term to differentiate clearly this quantity from other charges such as "color
        charge". The term specified in the SI Brochure has been given as a synonym.
        The definition in the SI Brochure has been revised to comply with the IEV
        rules.

  notes:
  - The elementary electric charge is equal to the charge of the proton and opposite
    to the charge of the electron.
  - The elementary electric charge is used in the {{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} to define
    the {{ampere, IEV:112-02-07}}.
