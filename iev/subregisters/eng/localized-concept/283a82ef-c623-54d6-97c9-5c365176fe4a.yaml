  definition: 'for a network containing `n` nodes and `b` branches and in which a
    reference direction is chosen for each branch, matrix of type `n` × `b` where
    the element `a`~`ij`~ is: <ul style="list-style: none;"> * 0 if branch `j` is
    not incident at node `i` * 1 if branch `j` is pointing away from node `i` * −1
    if branch `j` is pointing towards node `i`'
