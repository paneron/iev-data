  notes:
  - 1 The concept of antiparticle applies to both elementary particles, e.g. positron
    as antiparticle of electron, and compound particles, such as proton, neutron and
    atom.
  - 2 A particle and its antiparticle have in particular the same rest mass, the same
    spin quantum number, and opposite electric charges. Particle and antiparticle
    may be identical, for example photons.
  - 3 A particle and its antiparticle may interact, resulting in two photons. This
    process is usually called annihilation.
  - 4 An antiparticle is generally denoted by the same symbol as the corresponding
    particle but overlined, and its name is generally the name of the particle with
    the prefix anti, e.g. antiproton `bar p` corresponding to proton p, antihydrogen
    atom corresponding to hydrogen atom.
