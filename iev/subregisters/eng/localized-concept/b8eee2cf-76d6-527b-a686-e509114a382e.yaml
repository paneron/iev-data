    movement of a wavefront of a sinusoidal travelling wave, defined by a specified
    phase

  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the phase velocity to be considered is that in the
    direction of propagation.
  - In the direction of propagation, the magnitude of the phase velocity has a minimum
    value equal to the angular frequency divided by the absolute value of the real
    component of the wave vector.
