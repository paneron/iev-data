  notes:
  - "The general form of a quantity equation is `f`(`Q`~1~, `Q`~2~, ... `Qn`) = 0,\
    \ where `Q`~1~, `Q`~2~, ... `Qn` denote different quantities. A simple form of\
    \ a quantity equation is `Q`~1~ = `ζ` `Q`~2~ `Q`~3~, where `ζ` is a numerical\
    \ factor.\n\nExamples:\n\n\r\n* `T` = (1/2) `mv`^2^, where `T` is the kinetic\
    \ energy and `v` the speed of a specified particle of mass `m`;\r\n* `n` = `I`·`t`/`F`,\
    \ where `n` is the amount of substance of a univalent component, `I` is the electric\
    \ current and `t` the duration of the electrolysis, and where `F` is the Faraday\
    \ constant."
