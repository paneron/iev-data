  notes:
  - The coherence time is equal to coherence length divided by the phase velocity
    in a medium.
  - The coherence time is given approximately by `λ`~0~^2^/`c`~0~.Δ`λ` where `λ`~0~
    is the central wavelength, Δ`λ` is the spectral linewidth and `c`~0~ is the speed
    of light in vacuum.
