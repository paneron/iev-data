  definition: object colour stimuli that correspond to objects whose luminance factors
    have maximum possible values for each chromaticity when their spectral luminance
    factors do not exceed unity for any wavelength

  notes:
  - Optimal colour stimuli correspond, in general, to objects whose spectral luminance
    factors have values of either unity or zero, with not more than two transitions
    between them.
  - The luminance factors and chromaticity coordinates of optimal colour stimuli define
    the boundaries of a colour solid corresponding to non-fluorescent objects.
  - For a given luminance factor, optimal colour stimuli define the maximum purity
    possible for non-fluorescent objects.
