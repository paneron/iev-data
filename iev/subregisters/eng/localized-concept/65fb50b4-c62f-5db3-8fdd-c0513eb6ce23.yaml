  notes:
  - For many signals the value of a given physical quantity is identical with the
    value of the information parameter. In this case it is usual, for the sake of
    simplicity, to speak of the “value of a signal”.
  - For an amplitude-modulated alternating voltage signal the information parameter
    of the signal is the relationship between the actual amplitude to that amplitude
    the voltage would have without amplitude-modulation. For a duration- or position-modulated
    pulse signal the duration of each pulse or the position of each pulse within the
    pulse period respectively is the information parameter of the signal.
