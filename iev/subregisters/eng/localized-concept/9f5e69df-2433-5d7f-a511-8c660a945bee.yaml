  definition: quantity equal to the mass d`m` of substance crossing a given surface
    during a time interval with infinitesimal duration d`t`, divided by this duration,
    thus `q`~`m`~ = d`m` / d`t`

  notes:
  - 1 `q`~`m`~ = `ρq`~`v`~ where `ρ` is mass density and `q`~`v`~ is volume flow rate
    ({{113-03-72, IEV:113-03-72}}).
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of mass flow rate is kilogram per second, kg/s.
