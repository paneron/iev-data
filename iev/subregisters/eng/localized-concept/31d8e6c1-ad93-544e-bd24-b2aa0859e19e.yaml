  notes:
  - 'In applications in which an imprecision of a few hundredths of a second cannot
    be tolerated, it is necessary to specify the forms of universal time which should
    be used:


    – UT0 is the mean solar time of the prime meridian obtained from direct astronomical
    observation;


    – UT1 is UT0 corrected for the effects of small movements of the Earth relative
    to the axis of rotation in a stellar reference frame (polar variation);


    – UT2 is UT1 corrected for the effects of small seasonal fluctuation in the rate
    of rotation of the Earth in a stellar reference frame.'
  - The Mean Solar Time of Greenwich called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) may be regarded
    as the equivalent of Universal Time, but with a difference of 12 hours.
