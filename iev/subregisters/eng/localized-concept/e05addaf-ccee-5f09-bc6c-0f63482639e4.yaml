  definition: 'the fractional change of permeability due to a change in temperature
    divided by that change in temperature: `alpha_(mu) = ((mu_(theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_((ref))
    ( theta - theta_((ref)) )))` where `µθ` and `µ`~ref~ are the permeabilities at
    temperatures `θ` and `θ`~ref~ respectively'
