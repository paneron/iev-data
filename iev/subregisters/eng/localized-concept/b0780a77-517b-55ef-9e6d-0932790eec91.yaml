  notes:
  - 'The term "digit rate" can be qualified, for example: "{{binary digit rate, IEV:704-16-07}}",
    "{{ternary digit rate, IEV:704-16-08}}", "{{`n`-ary digit rate, IEV:704-16-09}}"
    when the {{number of significant conditions, IEV:702-05-22}} is respectively two,
    three, `n`.'
  - The term "digit rate" should not be used to express the transmission rate of a
    {{line signal, IEV:704-04-13}}) for which the appropriate term is "{{line digit
    rate, IEV:704-17-03}}".
