  definition: uniform chromaticity scale diagram produced by plotting in rectangular
    coordinates `v`′ against `u`′, quantities defined by the equations:<ul style="list-style-type:none;">*
    `u`′ = 4 `X` / (`X` + 15`Y` + 3`Z`) = 4`x` / (−2`x` + 12`y` + 3) * `v`′ = 9 `Y`
    / (`X` + 15`Y` + 3`Z`) = 9`y` / (−2`x` +12`y` + 3) where `X`, `Y`, `Z` are the
    <a href="IEV845-23-038">tristimulus values</a> in the CIE 1931 or 1964 standard
    colorimetric systems, and `x`, `y` are the corresponding chromaticity coordinates
    of the colour stimulus considered

  notes:
  - 'The CIE 1976 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram is a modification of, and supersedes,
    the CIE 1960 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram in which `v` was plotted against
    `u` in rectangular coordinates. The relationships between the two pairs of coordinates
    are: `u`′ = `u`; `v`′ = 1,5 `v`.'
