  definition: magneto-optic effect in which the electric flux density vector of a
    linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is rotated about the direction of propagation
    as it passes through a gyromagnetic medium subjected to a magnetostatic field
    having a component of magnetic field strength along the direction of propagation

  notes:
  - The Faraday effect is due to a birefringence where the refractive index is different
    for two waves circularly polarized in opposite senses. The angle of rotation is
    proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field strength and to the distance
    travelled in the medium. The coefficient of proportionality is called the Verdet
    constant.
