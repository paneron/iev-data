  definition: medium which can be electrically polarized and in which a time-varying
    electric field produces an electric current density the vector component of which
    in a given direction has a magnitude small compared with that of the vector component
    of the displacement current density in this direction, in a particular frequency
    band

  notes:
  - 'For sinusoidal conditions in an isotropic medium, the medium is dielectric if
    the following relation is satisfied:


    `(gamma)/((epsilon_0 omega)) ≫ epsilon^( '' )_r`


    where `γ` is the conductivity, `ε`~0~ the electric constant, `ω` the angular frequency
    and `ε`′~r~ the real relative permittivity.'
  - An anisotropic medium may be dielectric only in certain directions.
