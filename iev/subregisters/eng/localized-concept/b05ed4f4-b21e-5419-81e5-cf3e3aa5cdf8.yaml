  definition: relation between the <a href="IEV845-21-080">radiant exitance</a>, `M`~e~,
    of a Planckian radiator and its temperature, `T`, given by `M`~e~ = `σ` `T`^4^
    where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the thermodynamic temperature

  notes:
  - The Stefan-Boltzmann constant can be calculated by `sigma = ((2 pi^5 k^4))/((15
    h^3 c_0^2))` where `h` is the Planck constant, `c`~0~ is the {{speed of light
    in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}, and `k` is the Boltzmann constant.
  - For the value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `σ,` see CODATA.
