  definition: density of incident luminous flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface `E_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d A))` where `Φ`~v~ is luminous
    flux and `A` is the area on which the luminous flux is incident

  notes:
  - 'Illuminance can be derived from the spectral irradiance distribution by


    `E_v \ = \ K_m int_0^(oo) E_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, `E`~e,`λ`~(`λ`) is the spectral irradiance
    at wavelength `λ` and `V`(`λ`) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "irradiance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon irradiance".
  - The illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
