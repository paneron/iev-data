  notes:
  - 'The wavelength in a medium is equal to the wavelength in vacuo divided by the
    refractive index of the medium. In photometry, unless otherwise stated, values
    of wavelength are generally those in air. The refractive index of standard air
    (for spectroscopy: `T` = 15 °C, `p` = 101 325 Pa) lies between 1,000 27 and 1,000 29
    for <a href="IEV845-21-003">visible radiation</a>.'
  - In some specific applications, such as fluorescence measurements, the symbol `μ`
    is used for the wavelengths of excitation radiation.
  - '`λ` = `v` / `ν`, where `λ` is the wavelength in a medium, `v` is the phase velocity
    in that medium and `ν` is the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}.'
  - The wavelength is expressed in metres (m) or decimal submultiples of metre.
  - In <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>, the units nanometre (nm) and
    micrometre (μm) are generally used.
