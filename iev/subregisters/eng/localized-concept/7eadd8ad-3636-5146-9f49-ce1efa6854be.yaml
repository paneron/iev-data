  definition: relative decrease in radiant flux caused by absorption, expressed by
    the relative density of the spectral radiant flux, `Φ`~e,~`λ`(`λ`), with respect
    to propagation length, `l`, of a collimated beam at a point in an absorbing medium
    `a ( lambda ) = (1)/((Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ))) ((d Phi_((e , lambda)) (
    lambda )))/((d l))`

  notes:
  - The spectral linear absorption coefficient is expressed in metre to the power
    minus one (m^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-78 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
