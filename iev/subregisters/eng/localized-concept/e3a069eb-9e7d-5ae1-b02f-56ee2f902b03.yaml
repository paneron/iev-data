  definition: law relating the illuminance, `E`, on a real or imaginary surface to
    the luminous intensity, `I`, of an illuminating <a href="IEV845-21-033">point
    source</a> whereby `E = ((I cos theta))/((d^2))` where `Î¸` is the angle between
    the normal to the surface and the line between the surface and the source and
    `d` is the distance between the source and the surface

  notes:
  - The photometric distance law strictly only applies for a point source. However,
    it can also be applied for non-point sources at sufficiently large distances within
    acceptable limits of error or measurement uncertainty; in this case the degree
    of approximation at the distance used should be confirmed by measurement.
  - For radiometric sources the equivalent term is "radiometric distance law".
