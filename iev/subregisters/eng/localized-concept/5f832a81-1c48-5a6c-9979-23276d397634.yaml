  notes:
  - The hysteresis loss, `Q`~h~, is given as `Q`~h~ = (8/3`π`)`fd`~f~`ηJ`~ct~`B`~m~
    for a sufficiently high AC magnetic flux density `B`~m~ to which `Q`~h~ is proportional,
    where `f` is frequency, `d`~f~ is effective filament diameter, `J`~ct~ is transport
    critical current density and `η` is volume fraction of the superconductor.
