  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists only
    in an unsymmetrical three-phase system of sinusoidal quantities and which is defined
    by the following complex mathematical expression: `X`~2~ = 1/3(`X`~L1~ + `a`^2^`X`~L2~
    + `a` `X`~L3~) where `a` is the 120 degree operator, and `X`~L1~, `X`~L2~ and
    `X`~L3~ are the complex expressions of the phase quantities concerned, and where
    `X` denotes the system current or voltage phasors'
