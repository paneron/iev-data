  definition: quotient of transmitted radiant flux, `Φ`~t~, and incident radiant flux,
    `Φ`~m~ `tau = ((Phi_t))/((Phi_m))`

  notes:
  - Transmittance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, `α` + `ρ` + `τ` = 1 except when <a href="IEV845-21-017">polarized
    radiation</a> is observed, where `α` is absorptance and `ρ` is reflectance.
  - 'Transmittance, `τ`, is the sum of regular transmittance, `τ`~r~, and diffuse
    transmittance, `τ`~d~: `τ` = `τ`~r~ + `τ`~d~.'
  - The transmittance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-59 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
