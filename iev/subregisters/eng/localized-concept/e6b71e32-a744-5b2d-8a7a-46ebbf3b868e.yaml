  definition: 'relative amplitude of the periodic fluctuation of the luminous flux
    as calculated by the ratio of the difference between the maximum and the minimum
    instantaneous luminous flux, `Φ`~max~ and `Φ`~min~ respectively, to the sum of
    both of these values: `((Phi_((max)) - Phi_((min))))/((Phi_((max)) + Phi_((min))))`'

  notes:
  - The amplitude of fluctuation can be applied also for "luminance" and "illuminance".
    Additional photometric quantities can be used.
  - The amplitude of fluctuation of the luminous flux has unit one and is usually
    expressed in per cent (%).
  - This entry was numbered 845-07-66 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
