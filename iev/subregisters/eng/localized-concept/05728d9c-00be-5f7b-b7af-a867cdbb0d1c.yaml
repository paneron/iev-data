  definition: temperature of a Planckian radiator having the chromaticity nearest
    the chromaticity associated with the given <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a>
    on a modified 1976 UCS diagram where `u^( ' ) , (2)/(3) v^( ' )` are the coordinates
    of the Planckian locus and the test stimulus

  notes:
  - The concept of correlated colour temperature should not be used if the chromaticity
    of the test source differs more than `Delta C = ( u^( ' )_t - u^( ' )_p )^2 +
    (4)/(9) ( v^( ' )_t - v^( ' )_p )^2^((1)/(2)) = 5 xx 10^(- 2)` from the Planckian
    radiator, where `u^( ' )_t , v^( ' )_t` refer to the test source, and `u^( ' )_p
    , v^( ' )_p` to the Planckian radiator.
  - Correlated colour temperature can be calculated by a simple minimum search computer
    program that searches for that Planckian temperature that provides the smallest
    chromaticity difference between the test chromaticity and the Planckian locus,
    or for example by a method recommended by Robertson, A.R. "Computation of correlated
    color temperature and distribution temperature", _J. Opt. Soc. Am_. *58*, 1528-1535,
    1968. (Note that the values in some of the tables in this reference are not up
    to date.)
  - The chromaticity diagram originally used to determine the correlated colour temperature
    was the CIE 1960 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram. The CIE 1976 uniform-chromaticity-scale
    diagram is a modified version of the CIE 1960 uniform-chromaticity-scale diagram
    and is equivalent to the (u, 3/2 v) diagram.
  - The correlated colour temperature is expressed in kelvin (K).
