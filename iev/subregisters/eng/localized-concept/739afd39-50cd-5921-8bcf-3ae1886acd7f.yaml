  definition: difference between one and the ratio of the square of the mutual permeance
    `Λij` related to two circuit elements `i` and `j` to the product of their self-permeances
    `Λii` and `Λjj` `sigma_((i j)) = 1 - ((Lambda_(i j)^2))/((Lambda_((i i)) Lambda_((j
    j))))`

  notes:
  - 'The inductive leakage factor is related to the inductive coupling factor `kij`
    by the formula:


    `k_(i j)^2 = 1 - sigma_((i j))`'
