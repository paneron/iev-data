  definition: function assigning to any positive real number `a` and any real number
    `b` the positive real number denoted by `a^b` such that `a^0 = 1`, `a^1 = a` and
    `a^(b + c) = a^b * a^c` for any real numbers `b` and `c`

  notes:
  - The function which assigns to any real number `x` the number `a`^`x`^ is the exponential
    function to the base `a`. The function which assigns to any positive real number
    `x` the number `x`^`b`^ is a power function.
  - The exponentiation can be extended to negative real number `a` and integer `b`,
    and to other mathematical entities, for example, complex numbers, matrices and
    scalar quantities.
