  definition: real vector being tangent to a given oriented curve at a given point,
    the magnitude of which is the absolute value of the scalar line element at the
    given point and the direction of which corresponds to the orientation of the curve

  notes:
  - A vector line element is preferably designated by `e_t d s` or by `d r`, or sometimes
    by `t d s`, where `e_t = t` is a unit vector tangential to the curve, `d s` is
    a scalar line element, `d r` is the differential of the position vector *`r`*
    describing the curve with respect to an origin point.
