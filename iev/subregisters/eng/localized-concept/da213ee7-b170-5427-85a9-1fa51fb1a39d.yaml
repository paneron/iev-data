  notes:
  - 'An H-channel is usually characterized by one or two indices:


    - the first one refers to the channel digit rate; for example, an H~0~-channel
    has a digit rate of 384 kbit/s;


    - the second, if any, refers to the digital hierarchy; for example, an H~11~-channel
    has a digit rate of 1536 kbit/s, and an H~12~-channel has a digit rate of 1920
    kbit/s.'
  - A given H-channel may be subdivided into H-channels of lower digit rates, B channels
    and/or D-channels.
