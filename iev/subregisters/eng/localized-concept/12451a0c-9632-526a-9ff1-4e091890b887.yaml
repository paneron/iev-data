  definition: at a point of a line on the interface of two fluids or a fluid and a
    solid, quantity equal to the derivative of the component `F` of the force, tangent
    to the surface and perpendicular to the line, with respect to curvilinear abscissa
    `l`, thus `gamma = d F // d l`

  notes:
  - 1 The surface tension is equal to the work Δ`W` needed to expand the surface by
    an area Δ`A`, divided by Δ`A`, thus `γ` = Δ`W` / Δ`A.`
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of surface tension is newton per metre, N/m or, equally,
    joule per square meter, J/m^2^.
