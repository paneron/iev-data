  definition: 'between two terminals A and B, quantity `u`~AB~ equal to the difference
    of the electric potentials `v`~A~ at A and `v`~B~ at B: `u`~AB~ = `v`~A~ â€“ `v`~B~'

  notes:
  - In circuit theory, the electric field is assumed to be irrotational. Therefore,
    the definition is consistent with the definition given in electromagnetism for
    a more general case [121-11-27].
