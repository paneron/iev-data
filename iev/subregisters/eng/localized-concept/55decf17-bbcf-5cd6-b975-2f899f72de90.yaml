  definition: field, determined by a set of four interrelated vector quantities, that
    characterizes, together with the electric current density and the volumic electric
    charge, the electric and magnetic conditions of a material medium or of vacuum

  notes:
  - 'The four interrelated vector quantities, which obey Maxwell equations, are by
    convention:


    – the electric field strength `*E*` ,


    – the electric flux density `*D*` ,


    – the magnetic field strength `*H*` ,


    – the magnetic flux density `*B*` .'
  - This definition of electromagnetic field is valid in so far as certain quantum
    aspects of electromagnetic phenomena can be neglected.
