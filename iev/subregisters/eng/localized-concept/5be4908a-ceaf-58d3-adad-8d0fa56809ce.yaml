  definition: quotient of the coefficient of luminous intensity, `R`, of a plane retroreflective
    surface and its area, `A` `R_A = (R)/(A) = ((I // E_( _|_ )))/(A)` where `I` is
    the luminous intensity of the retroreflector in the direction of observation,
    and `E_( _|_ )` is the illuminance at the retroreflector on a plane perpendicular
    to the direction of the incident light

  notes:
  - The coefficient of retroreflection is particularly suitable for describing materials
    in sheet form.
  - Formerly, the symbol `R`′ was used for this quantity.
  - The coefficient of retroreflection is expressed in candela per lux per square
    metre (cd·lx^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-97 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
