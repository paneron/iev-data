        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules

  definition: quotient of the {{character mean entropy, IEV:171-07-28}} `H`^′^ by
    the mean duration of a character `H`^*^ = `H`^′^/`t`(`X`) where `X` = {`x`~1~,
    …, `x`~`n`~} is the set of input characters `xi` (`i` = 1, …, `n`) and `t ( X
    ) = sum_((n = 1))^n p ( x_i ) * t ( x_i )` is the mean value of the duration `t`(`xi`)
    of a character `xi` which occurs with probability `p`(`xi`)
