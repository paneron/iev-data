  definition: smallest steady-state asynchronous torque which the motor develops between
    zero speed and the speed which corresponds to the breakdown torque, when the motor
    is supplied at the rated voltage and frequency

  notes:
  - This definition does not apply to those induction motors of which the torque continually
    decreases with increase in speed.
  - In addition to the steady-state asynchronous torques, harmonic synchronous torques,
    which are a function of rotor load angle, will be present at specific speeds.
