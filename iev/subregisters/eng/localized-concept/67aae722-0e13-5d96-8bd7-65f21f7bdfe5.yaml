  notes:
  - Microvalves, which are composed of such {{components, IEV:151-11-21}} as {{actuators,
    IEV:151-13-49}} and diaphragms, made of silicon, etc., control the flow in microscopic
    channels (narrower than several micrometres). For example, a gas flow control
    valve is composed of a stacked {{piezoelectric actuator, IEV:523-04-10}} and a
    diaphragm. To control high-viscosity fluids such as blood, it is necessary to
    enlarge the channel and increase the stroke of the valve drive. A mechanism using
    a shape-memory alloy coil and a bias spring has been developed experimentally
    for this purpose, as well as a mechanism that alters the channel by an electrostatic,
    magnetic, or piezoelectric actuator.
