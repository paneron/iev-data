  notes:
  - For a curve from A to B defined by the position vector `r = f ( u )` as a function
    of the parameter `u` in the given interval &amp;lsqb;`a`, `b`&amp;rsqb; where
    `a &lt;= b`, the length of the curve is the line integral `int_A^B | d r | = int_a^b
    | ((d f))/((d u)) | d u`.
  - In the usual geometrical space, the length of a curve is a quantity of the dimension
    length.
