  definition: logarithm of the reciprocal of the conditional probability `p ( x |
    y )` of the event `x` given the occurrence of the event `y` `I ( x | y ) = log
    (1)/((p ( x | y )))`

  notes:
  - 'The conditional information content is also the amount by which the {{joint information
    content, IEV:171-07-20}} of the two events exceeds the {{information content,
    IEV:171-07-14}} of the second: `I ( x | y ) = I ( x , y ) - I ( y )`.'
