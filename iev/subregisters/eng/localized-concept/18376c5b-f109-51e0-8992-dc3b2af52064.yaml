  definition: disintegrations per unit time d`N`/d`t` for an {{atomic nucleus, IEV:113-05-21}}
    divided by the number of nuclei `N` existing at the same time `t` `lambda = -
    (1)/(N) xx ((d N))/((d t))`

  notes:
  - The decay constant is expressed in reciprocal seconds (s^−1^).
  - The decay constant may be considered the total probability of radioactive decay
    (disintegration and/or nuclear transition).
