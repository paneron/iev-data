  notes:
  - The direction of electric current is from the external circuit, through the anode,
    to the medium of lower conductivity.
  - In some cases (e.g. electrochemical cells), the term "anode" is applied to one
    or another electrode, depending on the electric operating condition of the device.
    In other cases (e.g. electronic tubes and semiconductor devices), the term "anode"
    is assigned to a specific electrode.
