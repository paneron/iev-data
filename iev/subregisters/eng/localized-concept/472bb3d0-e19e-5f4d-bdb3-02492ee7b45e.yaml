  notes:
  - When stating that an image area is a colorimetric neutral, it is necessary to
    designate the adopted white. For reflection <a href="IEV845-32-045">hardcopies</a>,
    the adopted white is typically considered to be either the media white or a perfectly
    diffuse reflecting surface illuminated by the light source.
  - The adopted white of colorimetric neutral can or cannot correspond to the <a href="IEV845-23-081">adapted
    white</a> according to an observer.
