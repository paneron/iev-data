  definition: quotient of the luminance, `L`, of a plane retroreflective surface in
    the direction of observation and the illuminance, `E_( _|_ )`, at the retroreflector
    on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident light `R_L = (L)/((E_(
    _|_ )))`

  notes:
  - The coefficient of retroreflected luminance is particularly suitable for describing
    materials in sheet form.
  - The coefficient of retroreflected luminance is expressed in candela per square
    metre per lux (cd·m^−2^·lx^−1^).
