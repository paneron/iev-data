  definition: the value of the coercive field strength in a material when the magnetic
    flux density, magnetic polarization or magnetization is brought from saturation
    by a monotonically changing magnetic field

  notes:
  - 'The parameter that is varied should be stated, and the appropriate symbol used
    as follows : `H`~c`B`~ for the coercivity relating to the flux density, `H`~c`J`~
    for the coercivity relating to the polarization, `H`~c`M`~ for the coercivity
    relating to the magnetization. The first two symbols supersede `BH`~c~ and `JH`~c~.'
