  definition: helium at pressures, `p`, and/or temperature, `T`, above the critical
    point (`p` > 227 kPa, `T` > 5,2 K) which is characterized by zero latent heat
    of vaporization and a continuous density function

  notes:
  - In magnet cooling application, high pressure (&gt; 227 kPa) helium near 4,2 K
    is also called supercritical helium.
