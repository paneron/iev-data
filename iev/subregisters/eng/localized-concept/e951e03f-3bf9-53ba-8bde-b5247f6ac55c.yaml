  notes:
  - By extension the words "attenuation" or "loss" may represent the ratio of powers
    in a given situation and in a reference condition;   for example "insertion loss".
  - Although the term "loss" is not synonymous in English with "attenuation" in every
    context, it is used to express the ratio of two powers in certain specified conditions
    as for example in "insertion loss" and "return loss", equivalent in French to
    "affaiblissement d'insertion" and "facteur d'adaptation" respectively.
  - Attenuation is generally expressed in logarithmic units by a positive value.
