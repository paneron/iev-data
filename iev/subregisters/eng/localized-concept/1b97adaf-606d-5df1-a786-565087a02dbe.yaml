  definition: 'for a network containing `l` directed loops and `b` branches, and in
    which a reference direction is chosen for each branch, matrix of type `l` × `b`
    where the element `a`~`ij`~ is: <ul style="list-style: none;"> * 0 if branch `j`
    is not in loop `i` * 1 if branch `j` is in loop `i` with the same direction *
    −1 if branch `j` is in loop `i` with opposite direction'

  notes:
  - – The figure gives a network and the corresponding branch-mesh incidence matrix
    when both loops 1 and 2 are directed anticlockwise.
