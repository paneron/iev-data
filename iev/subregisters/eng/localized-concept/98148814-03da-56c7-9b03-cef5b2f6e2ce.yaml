  notes:
  - The radiant spherical exposure is the quotient of the radiant energy of all radiation
    incident on the outer surface of an infinitely small sphere centred at the specified
    point and the area of the diametrical cross-section of that sphere.
  - The radiant spherical exposure is the appropriate radiometric quantity for describing
    a dose for a photobiological or photochemical effect in a scattering medium (e.g.
    light in skin). It is also the appropriate radiometric quantity for describing
    the irradiation of microorganisms. The radiant spherical exposure is frequently
    used incorrectly as a substitute for radiant exposure.
  - The radiant spherical exposure is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^ =
    W·s·m^−2^).
