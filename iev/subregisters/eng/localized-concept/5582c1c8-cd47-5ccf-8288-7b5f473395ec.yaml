  definition: quotient of blue light hazard weighted radiant flux, `Φ`~B~, and luminous
    flux, `Φ`~v~ `K_((B ,v)) = ((Phi_B))/((Phi_v)) = ((int Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda
    ) * B ( lambda ) * d lambda))/((K_m * int Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) * V (
    lambda ) * d lambda))` where `λ` is wavelength, `Φ`~e,`λ`~(`λ`) is spectral radiant
    flux, `B`(`λ`) is the blue light hazard spectral weighting function, `V`(`λ`)
    is the CIE <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a> function for
    photopic vision, and `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy (≈ 683 lm·W^−1^)

  notes:
  - The term "luminous radiation" refers to <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>
    weighted with the CIE spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision,
    `V`(`λ`).
  - The use of this term is only reasonable if parts of the optical radiation are
    in the visible range and thus `Φ`~v~ ≠ 0.
  - The blue light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation is expressed in watt per
    lumen (W·lm^−1^), possibly with a metric prefix.
