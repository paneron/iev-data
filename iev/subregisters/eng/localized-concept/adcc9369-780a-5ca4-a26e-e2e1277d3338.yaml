  definition: under {{sinusoidal conditions, IEV:131-11-28}} in a medium where the
    {{phasors, IEV:131-11-26}} <u>`*D*`</u> and <u>`*E*`</u> representing respectively
    the {{electric flux density, IEV:121-11-40}} and the {{electric field strength,
    IEV:121-11-18}} are linearly related, complex quantity `ε`~ r~ defined by the
    relation <u>`*D*`</u> = `ε`~0~`ε`~ r~ <u>`*E*`</u> where `ε`~0~ is the {{electric
    constant, IEV:121-11-03}}

  notes:
  - The complex relative permittivity is generally frequency dependent. For an isotropic
    medium, the complex relative permittivity is a {{scalar quantity, IEV:102-02-19}};
    for an anisotropic medium, it is a {{tensor quantity, IEV:102-03-40}}.
  - Generally, `ε`~r~  is expressed as `ε`~ r~ = `ε'`~ r~ − j`ε''`~r~  where `ε'`~r~
    is the {{real relative permittivity, IEV:121-12-15}} and `ε''`~r~ is the {{dielectric
    loss index, IEV:121-12-16}}, which represents {{dielectric losses, IEV:121-12-11}}.
