  definition: quotient of the radiant flux at wavelength `λ`~m~ and that at wavelength
    `λ`, such that both produce equally intense luminous sensations for a specified
    photometric condition and `λ`~m~ is chosen so that the maximum value of this quotient
    is equal to 1

  notes:
  - The spectral luminous efficiency of the human eye depends on a number of factors,
    particularly the state of visual adaptation and the size and position of the source
    in the visual field. The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic,
    scotopic, mesopic). If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the
    symbol `V`(`λ`) is used. The values of the `V`(`λ`) function have been internationally
    agreed in 1924 by the CIE (_Compte Rendu 6e session_, p. 67), completed by interpolation
    and extrapolation &amp;lsqb;ISO 23539:2005(E)/CIE S 010/E:2004, _Photometry –
    The CIE System of Physical Photometry_&amp;rsqb;, and recommended by the International
    Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) in 1972.
  - For scotopic vision, the symbol `V`′(`λ`) is used. The values of the `V`′(`λ`)
    function were adopted by the CIE in 1951, were published in _Compte Rendu 12e
    session, Vol. 3_, p. 37 and in ISO 23539:2005(E)/CIE S 010/E:2004, _Photometry
    – The CIE System of Physical Photometry_, and ratified by the CIPM in 1976.
  - For mesopic vision, the spectral luminous efficiency function is denoted by `V`~mes;~`m`(`λ`),
    where `m` is a coefficient determined by the visual adaptation level. The values
    of the `V`~mes;~`m`(`λ`) function at representative values of `m` are given in
    CIE 191:2010, _Recommended System for Mesopic Photometry based on Visual Performance_.
  - 'The `V`(`λ`) function applies at all luminance levels for foveal conditions,
    i.e. for all on-axis visual tasks (where objects seen by the eye are in a narrow
    field of view). For visual tasks that are not on-axis, the following specifications
    are given by CIE 191:2010, _Recommended System for Mesopic Photometry based on
    Visual Performance_: Scotopic photometric quantities are applicable to the condition
    where the eye is adapted to an average luminance of &lt; 0,005 cd·m^−2^; mesopic
    photometric quantities are applicable to the condition where the eye is adapted
    to average luminance levels between 0,005 cd·m^−2^ and 5 cd·m^−2^; photopic photometric
    quantities are applicable to the condition where the eye is adapted to an average
    luminance greater than 5 cd·m^−2^.'
  - Considering that the spectral luminous efficiency function of the human eye changes
    with visual angle, in 2005 CIE adopted the "CIE 10° photopic photometric observer",
    `V`~10~(`λ`), and recommended it for situations where the eye is fully light adapted
    and the visual target has an angular subtense larger than 4° or is seen off-axis
    (see CIE 165:2005, _CIE 10 Degree Photopic Photometric Observer_).
  - Considering the discrepancies between the average human spectral luminous efficiency
    and the `V`(`λ`) function, in 1990 CIE adopted the "CIE 1988 Modified 2° Spectral
    Luminous Efficiency Function for Photopic Vision", `V`~M~(`λ`), and recommended
    it for applications in visual sciences (see CIE 86-1990, _CIE 1988 2° Spectral
    Luminous Efficiency Function for Photopic Vision_).
  - 'Photometric quantities are calculated by integrating the product of the radiometric
    quantity by the spectral luminous efficiency function and then multiplying by
    the maximum of the stated spectral luminous efficacy function, with the integral
    being taken across the full <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> spectrum.
    For example, for the CIE standard observer for photopic vision, the luminous flux
    of a source with spectral radiant flux `Φ`~e,~`λ`(`λ`) is expressed by


    `Phi_v = K_m int_0^(oo) Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ ≈ 683 lm·W^−1^ (see also "<a href="IEV845-21-092">maximum luminous
    efficacy</a>").'
  - The spectral luminous efficiency has unit one.
