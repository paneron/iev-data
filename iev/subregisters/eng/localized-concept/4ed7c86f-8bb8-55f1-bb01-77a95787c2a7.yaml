  notes:
  - 'It represents the efficiency of converting electric energy into mechanical energy
    by the electro-mechanical coupling effect, and it is defined as the square root
    of the ratio of the mechanical energy stored (`U`~m~) to the total input electric
    energy transferred (`U`~i~):


    `k = sqrt(((U_m ))/((U_i)))`'
