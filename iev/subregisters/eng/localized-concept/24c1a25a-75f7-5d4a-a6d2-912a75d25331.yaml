  notes:
  - Steady-state instability usually occurs due to excessive power transfers.
  - Under this condition, the derivative of the active power with respect to the angle
    of deviation between at least one generator's e.m.f. and the reference e.m.f.
    is negative.
  - A power system is steady-state unstable for a steady-state operating condition
    if, following any small disturbance, it fails to reach a steady-state operating
    condition.
