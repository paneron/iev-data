  notes:
  - 'The vector defining a vector quantity is generally a unit vector in the usual
    two- or three-dimensional geometrical space. A vector quantity can then be represented
    as an oriented line segment characterized by its point of acting, its direction
    and its magnitude, where the magnitude is a non-negative number multiplied by
    a unit of measurement. The components are also the product of a numerical value
    and the unit. Examples of vector quantities are: velocity, force, electric field
    strength.'
  - A vector quantity may be considered either as attached to a point of acting (localized
    or bound vector), or as having any point of acting on a straight line parallel
    to it (sliding vector), or as having any point of acting in the space (free vector).
  - Operations defined for vectors apply to vector quantities. For example, the product
    of a scalar quantity `p` and the vector quantity `Q = q e` is the vector quantity
    `p Q = p q e`, where *`e`* is a unit vector.
