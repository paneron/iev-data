  definition: 'duration `t`~SU~ between the application of the supply voltage to the
    oscillator and the time when the RF output signal of desired frequency controlled
    by the quartz resonator fulfils the following specified conditions: . for quasi-sinusoidal
    waveforms, the signal envelope is 90 % of the steady-state peak-to-peak amplitude;
    . for pulse waveforms, the output pulse sequence is periodical near the steady-state
    frequency while its low level `V`~LO~ remains below `V`~OL~ and its high level
    `V`~HI~ exceeds `V`~OH~ permanently, where `V`~OH~ and `V`~OL~ are defined by
    the applicable logic family'
