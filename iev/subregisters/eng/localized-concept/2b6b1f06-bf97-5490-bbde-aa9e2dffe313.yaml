  definition: '{{modulation, IEV:701-03-08}} by a {{discretely timed signal, IEV:702-04-04}}
    in which there is a predetermined relationship between the instants characterizing
    the {{carrier, IEV:702-06-03}} phase prior to modulation and the {{significant
    instants, IEV:721-02-29}} of the {{modulated signal, IEV:702-06-05}}'
  examples:
  - Modulation in which the significant instants  of the modulated signal coincide
    with zero crossings of the carrier.
