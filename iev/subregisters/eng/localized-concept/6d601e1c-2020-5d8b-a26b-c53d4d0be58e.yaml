  notes:
  - 1 Amount of heat is a process quantity, not a state quantity. It depends on how
    the change from one state to another has been obtained and is only partly transformable
    into work.
  - 2 A supply of heat may correspond to an increase of thermodynamic temperature
    or to other effects, such as phase transition or chemical processes.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of amount of heat is joule, J.
