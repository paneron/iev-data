  notes:
  - The take-over current is a limiting value of current above which, in the presence
    of two overcurrent protective devices in series, the protective device generally,
    but not necessarily, on the supply side, provides back-up operation for the other
    protective device.
  - '{{`I`^2^`t` characteristics, IEV:442-05-59}} can be used instead of time–current
    characteristics.'
