  definition: strength of coupling between coupled resonators which is defined as
    the ratio of coupled energy to stored energy and can be obtained from two split
    resonance frequencies by `k` = (`f`~h~^2^ â€“ `f`~l~^2^) / (`f`~h~^2^ + `f`~l~^2^)
    where `f`~h~ is the higher resonance frequency and `f`~l~ is the lower resonance
    frequency

  notes:
  - The coupling is mainly made either magnetically or electrically which is called
    magnetic or electric coupling, respectively.
