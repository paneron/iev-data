  notes:
  - Inclination of the orbital plane of a geostationary satellite gives rise to apparent
    movement of the satellite as seen from Earth which is mainly to the north and
    the south, whereas orbital ellipticity and imprecision in maintaining the period
    of revolution of the satellite give rise to apparent movement, as seen from Earth,
    which is mainly to the east and the west.
