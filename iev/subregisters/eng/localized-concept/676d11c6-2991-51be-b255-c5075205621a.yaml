  notes:
  - Nanoimprint is classified into two types according to the difference in moulding
    method. Thermoplastic nanoimprint utilizes temperature and pressure controls with
    thermoplastic materials. Photo nanoimprint utilizes light irradiation with photo-curable
    materials. The hot-embossing process, a conventional technique, is a similar fabrication
    process to the thermoplastic nanoimprint. In some cases, hot-embossing and nanoimprint
    are distinguished through the moulding processes to form bulk-film materials and
    thin-film materials on a {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}}, respectively.
