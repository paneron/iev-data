  definition: the complex ratio of a sinusoidal field quantity, such as a reflected
    current or reflected wave component, to the corresponding field quantity of the
    incident current or incident wave at a point near the surface separating two propagation
    media, near a port of an electrical network or near a discontinuity in a transmission
    line

  notes:
  - 1 – When the field quantity is a component of a plane electromagnetic wave, the
    sign of the reflection factor is different for an electric field component and
    the corresponding magnetic field component.
  - 2 – When the field quantity refers to a port of an electrical network, or to a
    discontinuity in a transmission line, a voltage reflection factor can be defined
    with a sign opposite to that of the current reflection factor.
  - '3 – When impedances can be defined, the complex current reflection factor `r`
    equals:


    `underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) - underset(_)(Z)^( '' )))/((underset(_)(Z)
    + underset(_)(Z)^( '' )))`


    where `Z` is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line ahead of the
    discontinuity or the impedance of the source and `Z`′ is the impedance after the
    discontinuity or the load impedance seen from the junction between the source
    and the load.'
  - 4 – The reflection factor depends in the case of waveguides on the electromagnetic
    mode considered.
