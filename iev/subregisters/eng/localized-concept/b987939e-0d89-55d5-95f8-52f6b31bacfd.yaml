  notes:
  - By extension, a scalar is also an element of a set for which an addition and a
    commutative multiplication are defined, each with a neutral element, such that
    any element has an opposite and any element other than the neutral element for
    addition has an inverse.
  - Sets of scalars, including the extension of Note 1, are usually called fields
    in mathematics. The set of real numbers and the set of complex numbers are infinite
    fields. An example of a finite field is the set of two elements 0 and 1 subject
    to Boolean algebra (where 1 + 1 = 0).
