  notes:
  - The conditions for other than rotating machines are specified in IEC 60529, _Degrees
    of protection provided by enclosures (IP Code)_.
  - 'The detailed test requirements for rotating electric machines are in IEC 60034-5,
    _Rotating electrical machines – Part 5: Degrees of protection provided by the
    integral design of rotating electrical machines (IP code) – Classification_.'
  - The enclosure which provides the degree of protection IP is not necessarily the
    same as the equipment enclosure providing the Type of Protection.
  - An enclosure which provides the degree of protection required by one of the Types
    of Protection will have been subjected to other tests prior to the tests for degree
    of protection.
