  notes:
  - An FDM telephone channel normally has a standardized bandwidth of 4 kHz, this
    being sufficient for a signal occupying a frequency band of 300-3 400 Hz, for
    outband signalling, and for the required guard bands.
  - Signals, other than speech signals, having appropriate specified characteristics
    may occupy the whole or a part of an FDM telephone channel.
