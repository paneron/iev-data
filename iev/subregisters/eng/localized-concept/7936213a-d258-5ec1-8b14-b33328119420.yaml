  notes:
  - 'The characteristic impedance of a homogeneous isotropic medium is given by:


    `Z_i = sqrt(((mu_0 (underset(_)(mu))_r))/((epsilon_0 (underset(_)(epsilon))_r)))`


    where


    `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant,


    `μ`~r~ is the relative complex permeability,


    `ε`~0~ is the electric constant,


    `ε`~r~ is the relative complex permittivity.'
