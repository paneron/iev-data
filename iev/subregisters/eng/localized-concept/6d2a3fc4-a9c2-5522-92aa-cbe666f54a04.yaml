  definition: functional unit with two inputs and one output the value of the output
    variable of which is equal to the quotient of the value of the first input variable
    multiplied by a constant weighting factor to the second input variable multiplied
    by a constant weighting factor according to the formula `v ( t ) = K_0 * ((K_1
    * u_1 ( t )))/((K_2 * u_2 ( t )))` where<table> <tr> <td>`t`</td> <td>is the time;</td>
    </tr> <tr> <td> `K`~0~, `K`~1~ ...</td> <td>are the weighting factors;</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> `u`~1~, `u`~2~ </td> <td>are the input variables;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>`v`</td>
    <td>is the division result.</td> </tr> </table>
