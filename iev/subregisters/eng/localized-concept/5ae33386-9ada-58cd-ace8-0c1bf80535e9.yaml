  definition: for a linear time-invariant system described by the second order differential
    equation `((d^2 x))/((d t^2)) + 2 * vartheta * omega_0 * ((d x))/((d t)) + omega_0^2
    * x = 0` the value of the coefficient `vartheta`, where <table> <tr> <td>`t`</td>
    <td>is the time;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>`x`</td> <td>is a state variable of the system;</td>
    </tr> <tr> <td> `Ï‰`~0~ </td> <td>is the characteristic angular frequency of the
    system</td> </tr> </table>

  notes:
  - When `vartheta 1`, `omega_d = omega_0 * sqrt(1 - vartheta^2)` is the eigen angular
    frequency of the system.
