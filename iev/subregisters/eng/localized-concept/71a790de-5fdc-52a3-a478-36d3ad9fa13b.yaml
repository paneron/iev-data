  definition: 'pertaining to an operating characteristic, a device, an electrical
    network or a transmission medium for which: - at a specified output port, the
    signal resulting from an arbitrary input signal applied to a given port is such
    that, when the input signal is increased by a numerical factor, the output signal
    does not increase by the same factor over the whole extent of the specified working
    range; - at a specified output port the total signal resulting from the simultaneous
    application of a number of arbitrary input signals, either individually to given
    independent ports or collectively into one given port, is not, over the whole
    extent of the specified working range, equal to the sum of individual outputs
    which would be produced by the application to the same ports of the same input
    signals, each acting separately'

  notes:
  - A device which is non-linear over its specified working range may show a linear
    behaviour for signals within a limited working range.
  - A device with several ports may be non-linear for a certain set of ports and linear
    for other sets of ports.
