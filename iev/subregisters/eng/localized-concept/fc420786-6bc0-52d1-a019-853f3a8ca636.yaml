  definition: for an inductive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, quotient
    of the linked flux `Ψ` between the terminals by the electric current `i` in the
    element `L = (Psi)/(i)` where the sign of the linked flux is determined by taking
    the voltage, in the time integral defining it, as the difference of the electric
    potentials at terminals at A and B, and where the current is taken as positive
    if its direction is from A to B and negative if its direction is from B to A

  notes:
  - An inductance cannot be negative.
  - In French, the term “inductance” is also a short term for “bobine d’inductance”,
    in English “inductor” ({{151-13-25, IEV:151-13-25}}).
  - The coherent SI unit of inductance is henry, H.
