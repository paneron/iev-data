  notes:
  - The spectral purity is usually represented as the signal side noise power spectrum
    expressed in decibels relative to total signal power, per hertz bandwidth. This
    spectral purity includes non-deterministic noise power, harmonic distortion components
    and spurious frequency interferences.
