  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the mass density `ρ` of a substance
    divided by the mass density `ρ`~0~ of a reference substance, under conditions
    that should be specified for both substances, thus `d` = `ρ`/`ρ`~0~

  - For `ρ`~0~, the mass density of liquid water at 4 °C (1 000 kg/m^3^) is often
    used.
