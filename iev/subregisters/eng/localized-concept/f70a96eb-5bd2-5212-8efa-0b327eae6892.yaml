  notes:
  - '1 – The decibel may also be used to express the ratio of two field quantities.
    To obtain the same numerical value as for the corresponding power ratio, the logarithm
    of the field quantity ratio is multiplied by the factor 20, assuming that the
    impedances are equal.


    If `P`~1~ and `P`~2~ are two powers, their ratio expressed in decibels is:


    `10 lg ((P_1))/((P_2))`


    The relation between a field quantity ratio and the corresponding power ratio
    is dependent on the impedances.


    If `P`~1~ and `P`~2~ represent the powers dissipated by currents `I`~1~ and `I`~2~
    in resistances `R`~1~ and `R`~2~, then:


    `10 lg ((P_1))/((P_2)) = 10 lg ((I_1^2))/((I_2^2)) ((R_1))/((R_2)) = 20 lg ((I_1))/((I_2))
    + 10 lg ((R_1))/((R_2))`'
  - 2 – Guidance for the use of the decibel and appropriate symbols to represent the
    ratios of various quantities is given in CCIR Recommendation 574, in CCITT Recommendation
    B.12, and in IEC publication 27-3.
