  notes:
  - The absence of necessary external resources may prevent operation, but do not
    affect the up state. See externally disabled state ({{192-02-23, IEV:192-02-23}}).
  - Up state relates to the availability of the item.
  - An item may be considered to be in an up state for some functions and in a down
    state for others, concurrently.
  - The adjectives "up" and “available” designate an item in an up state.
