    containing that frequency by the bandwidth when the bandwidth tends to zero

  notes:
  - The instantaneous power of a quantity is by convention equal to the square of
    its instantaneous value. This square is proportional to a physical power if the
    considered quantity is a field quantity.
  - The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function.
