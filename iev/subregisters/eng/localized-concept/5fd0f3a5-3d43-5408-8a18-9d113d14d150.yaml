  notes:
  - '1 Forces cause the particle or body to change its momentum *`p`* = `mv` according
    to the second Newton law: d*`p`*/d`t` = *`F`* (in inertial frame), where *`F`*
    is the resultant of all acting forces. The equation applies also in the theory
    of relativity.'
  - 2 Force may lead to the deformation of the body.
  - 3 In any inertial frame, a resultant force *`F`* acting on a body with constant
    mass `m` causes an acceleration *`a`* = *`F`*/`m` of the centre of mass of the
    body.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of force is newton, N.
