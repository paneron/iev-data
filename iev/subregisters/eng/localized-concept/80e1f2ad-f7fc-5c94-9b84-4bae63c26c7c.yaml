  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing a transfer of heat, defined by
    `N u = ((K l))/(lambda)`, where `K` is coefficient of heat transfer, `l` is a
    length characterizing the configuration, and `λ` is thermal conductivity

  notes:
  - 1 The Nusselt number is often calculated by empiric formulas as a function of
    other characteristic numbers (Reynolds number `Re`, Prandtl number `Pr`, Péclet
    number `Pe`, Grashof number `Gr`), and then used to determine the coefficient
    of heat transfer `K`.
  - 2 The name “Biot number”, symbol `Bi`, is used when the Nusselt number is reserved
    for convective transport of heat.
