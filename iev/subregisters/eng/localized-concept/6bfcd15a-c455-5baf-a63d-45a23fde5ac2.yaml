  - 'A telegraph channel can be qualified by the number of significant conditions
    and by the modulation rate it is designed to admit.


    Example: A 50 baud channel for two-condition modulation.'
  - Several telegraph channels can share a common path; for example each channel is
    allocated a particular frequency band or a particular time-slot.
