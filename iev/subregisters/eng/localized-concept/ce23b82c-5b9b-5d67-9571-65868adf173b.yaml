  definition: of a material for indirectly ionizing particles, the quotient d`N`/`N`
    by `ρ` d`l`,where d`N`/`N` is the fraction of particles that experience interactions
    in traversing a distance d`l` in a medium of density `ρ` `(mu)/(rho) = (1)/((rho
    N)) ((d N))/((d l))`

  notes:
  - The mass attenuation coefficient `(mu)/(rho)` for X-radiation and gamma-radiation
    may be expressed as the sum of several parts, each attributed to a particular
    phenomenon; `(tau)/(rho)` for the photoelectric effect; `((sigma_c))/(rho)` for
    the Compton effect; `((sigma_((coh))))/(rho)` for coherent scattering; and `(kappa)/(rho)`
    for pair production.
