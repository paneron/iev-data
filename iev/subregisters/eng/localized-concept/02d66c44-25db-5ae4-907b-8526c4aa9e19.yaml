  definition: expression of the dependence of a quantity on the {{base quantities,
    IEV:112-01-08}} of a system of quantities as a product of powers of factors corresponding
    to the base quantities, omitting any numerical factor

  notes:
  - A power of a factor is the factor raised to an exponent. Each factor is the dimension
    of a base quantity.
  - The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is
    a single upper case letter in roman (upright) sans-serif type. The conventional
    symbolic representation of the dimension of a derived quantity is the product
    of powers of the dimensions of the base quantities according to the definition
    of the derived quantity. The dimension of a quantity `Q` is denoted by dim `Q`.
  - In deriving the dimension of a quantity, no account is taken of its scalar, vector
    or tensor character.
  - "In a given system of quantities,\r\n\r\n* quantities of the same kind (see {{IEV\
    \ 112-01-04, IEV:112-01-04}}) have the same dimension,\r\n* quantities of different\
    \ dimensions are always of different kinds, and\r\n* quantities having the same\
    \ dimension are not necessarily of the same kind. For example, in the {{International\
    \ System of Quantities, IEV:112-02-01}} (ISQ), pressure and energy density (volumic\
    \ energy) have the same dimension L^–1^MT^–2^. See also note 5."
  - "In the International System of Quantities (ISQ), the symbols representing the\
    \ dimensions of the base quantities are:\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"\

    \nThus, the dimension of a quantity `Q` is denoted by dim `Q` = `L``α``M``β``T``γ``I``δ``Θ``ε``N``ζ``J``η`,\
    \ where the exponents, named dimensional exponents, are positive, negative, or\
    \ zero. Factors with exponent 0 are usually omitted. When all exponents are zero,\
    \ the symbol `1`, printed in sans-serif type, is used to represent the dimension.\
    \ Examples are:\r\n\r\n* The dimension of force is dim `F` = LMT^–2^.\r\n* Mass\
    \ concentration of a given component and mass density (volumic mass) have the\
    \ same dimension ML^–3^.\r\n* Electric current and scalar magnetic potential have\
    \ the same dimension I^1^ = I, although they are not quantities of the same kind."
  - 'An exponent can be fractional.


    The period `T` of a pendulum of length `l` at a place with the local acceleration
    of free fall `g` is:


    `T = 2 pi sqrt((1)/(g))` or `T = C ( g ) sqrt(l)` where


    `C ( g ) = ((2 pi))/((sqrt(g)))`


    Hence dim `C`(`g`) = `T`· `L`^−1/2^.'
