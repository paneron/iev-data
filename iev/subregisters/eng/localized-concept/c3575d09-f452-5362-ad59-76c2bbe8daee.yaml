  notes:
  - 'If the power supply to customer `j` is interrupted `n`~`j`~ times during a time
    interval of duration `T`, and the total number of customers served is `N`~S~,
    then interruption frequency per customer served is given by


    `f_((CS)) = ((sum_j n_j))/((N_S T))`'
  - Usually, only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Interruption frequency per customer served can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
