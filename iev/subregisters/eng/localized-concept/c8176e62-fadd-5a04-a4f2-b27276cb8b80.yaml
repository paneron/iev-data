  notes:
  - 'The spherical illuminance can be expressed by


    `E_((v,o)) = underset((4 pi))( int ) L_v d omega`


    where `Ω` is solid angle and `L`~v~ is luminance.'
  - The spherical illuminance is the quotient of the luminous flux of all the light
    incident on the outer surface of an infinitely small sphere centred at the given
    point and the area of the diametrical cross-section of that sphere.
  - The analogous quantities "<a href="IEV845-21-054">spherical irradiance</a>", `E`~e,o~,
    and "<a href="IEV845-21-059">photon spherical irradiance</a>" (also termed "photon
    fluence rate"), `E`~p,o~, are defined in a similar way, replacing <a href="IEV845-21-050">luminance</a>,
    `L`~v~, by <a href="IEV845-21-049">radiance</a>, `L`~e~, and photon radiance,
    `L`~p~, respectively.
  - The spherical illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
