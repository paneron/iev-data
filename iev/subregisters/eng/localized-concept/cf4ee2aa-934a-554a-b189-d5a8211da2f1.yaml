  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of natural
    convection and thermal conduction, defined by `R a = ((l^3 rho^2 c_p g alpha_V
    Delta T))/((eta lambda)) = ((l^3 g alpha_V Delta T))/((nu alpha))`, where `l`
    is a specified length, `ρ` is mass density, `c`~`p`~ is specific heat capacity
    at constant pressure, `g` is acceleration of free fall, `α`~`v`~ is the cubic
    expansion coefficient, `T` is thermodynamic temperature, `η` is dynamic viscosity,
    `λ` is thermal conductivity, and `α` is thermal diffusivity

  notes:
  - The Rayleigh number is the product of the Grashof number `Gr` and the Prandtl
    number `Pr`, thus `Ra` = `Gr` ⋅ `Pr`.
