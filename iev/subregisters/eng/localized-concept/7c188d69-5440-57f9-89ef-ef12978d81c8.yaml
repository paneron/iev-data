  definition: functional unit with two or several inputs and one output the value
    of the output variable of which is equal to the product of the values of the input
    variables multiplied by constant weighting factors according to the formula `v
    ( t ) = K_0 * K_1 * u_1 ( t ) * K_2 * u_2 ( t ) * K_3 * u_3 ( t ) * ...` where<table>
