  definition: for a tensor of the second order `T = ( T_((i j)) )` and a vector *`U`*
    = (`Uk`), vector the components of which are given by `(( T * U ))_i = underset(m)(
    sum ) T_((i m)) U_m`

  notes:
  - The inner product of two vectors is their scalar product, because a tensor of
    the first order is considered as a vector.
  - An example is the relation `D = vec vec epsilon * E` between the electric field
    strength *`E`* and the electric flux density *`D`*, where `vec vec epsilon` is
    the absolute permittivity of an anisotropic medium.
  - The inner product of a tensor and a vector is denoted by a half-high dot (Â·) between
    the two symbols.
