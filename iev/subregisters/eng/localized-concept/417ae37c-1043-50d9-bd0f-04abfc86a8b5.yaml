  definition: specific scaling law of the pinning force density in which the pinning
    force density `F`~p~ is given as `F`~p~ ∝ `b`^1/2^ (1 − `b`)^2^, where `b` = `B`/`B`~c2~
    and `B`~c2~ = `μ`~0~`H`~c2~, where `μ`~0~ is the magnetic constant and `H`~c2~
    is the upper critical field strength
