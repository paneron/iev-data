    of the band

  notes:
  - The kind of quantity must be specified, such as by (squared) sound pressure spectrum
    level.
  - 'In view of the fact that filters have finite bandwidths, practically the sound
    pressure spectrum level `L`~ps~ is obtained for the centre frequency of the band
    by the formula:


    `L_((ps)) = 10 (log)_((10)) ((( p^2 // B )))/((( p_0^2 // B_0 ))) dB`


    where `p` and `p`~0~ are respectively the given field quantity and the reference
    quantity; `B` et `B`~0~ are respectively the effective bandwidth of the filter
    and the reference bandwidth of 1 Hz.


    When `L`~p~ is the band pressure level observed through the filter, the above
    relation reduces to


    `L_((ps)) = L_p - (log)_((10)) ( B // B_0 ) dB`'
