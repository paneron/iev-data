  notes:
  - 'ISO/IEC 80079-20-2, _Explosive atmospheres – Part 20-2: Material characteristics
    – Combustible dusts test methods_, contains the test method for determining the
    electrical resistivity of dusts.'
  - Metal dust is treated as conductive dust because it is assumed that surface oxidation
    cannot be depended upon to always ensure electrical resistivity greater than 1
    × 10^3^ Ω·m.
