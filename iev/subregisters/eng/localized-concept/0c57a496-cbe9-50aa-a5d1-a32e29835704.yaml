  definition: ratio of the effective radius of the Earth to the actual Earth radius

  notes:
  - 'This factor `k` is related to the vertical gradient d`n`/d`h` of the refractive
    index n and to the actual Earth radius `a` by the equation:


    `k = (1)/((1 + a ((d n))/((d h))))`'
  - For an atmosphere having a standard refractivity gradient the value of `k` is
    taken as 4/3, corresponding to an effective radius of the Earth of approximately
    8Â 500 km.
