  definition: under sinusoidal conditions in a medium where the phasors <u>`D`</u>,
    <u>`E`</u> and <u>`J`</u> representing respectively the electric flux density,
    the electric field strength and the electric current density are linearly related,
    complex quantity `ε`~re~ defined by the relation `epsilon_0 underset(_)(epsilon)_((re))
    underset(_)(E) = underset(_)(D) + ((underset(_)(J)))/((j omega)) = underset(_)(D)
    - j ((gamma underset(_)(E)))/(omega)` where `γ` is the conductivity of the medium,
    `ω` the angular frequency and `ε`~0~ the electric constant

  notes:
  - The effective complex relative permittivity is generally frequency dependent.
    For an isotropic medium the effective complex relative permittivity is a scalar;
    for an anisotropic medium it is a tensor.
  - 'The effective complex relative permittivity and the complex relative permittivity
    `ε`~r~ are linked by the relation


    `underset(_)(epsilon)_((re)) = underset(_)(epsilon)_r - ((j gamma ))/((epsilon_0
    omega))`


    In a conductive medium, including good conductors and imperfect dielectrics, the
    useful and measurable quantity is the effective complex relative permittivity.'
  - The negative of the imaginary part of the effective complex relative permittivity
    represents both dielectric losses and losses due to the conductivity, the part
    due to conductivity being represented by `γ`/`ε`~0~`ω`.
