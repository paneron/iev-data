  definition: density of incident <a href="IEV845-21-037">luminous energy</a> with
    respect to area at a point on a real or imaginary surface `H_v = ((d Q_v))/((d
    A))` where `Q`~v~ is luminous energy and `A` is the area on which the luminous
    energy is incident

  notes:
  - The term "light exposure" is no longer used.
  - 'Luminous exposure can be derived from the spectral radiant exposure distribution
    by


    `H_v \ = \ K_m int_0^(oo) H_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, `H`~e,~`λ`(`λ`) is the spectral radiant
    exposure at wavelength `λ` and `V`(`λ`) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous
    efficiency</a>. Integral limits can be confined depending on the spectral <a href="IEV845-25-061">responsivity</a>
    of the detectors used as a sensor.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exposure". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exposure"
  - The luminous exposure is expressed in lux second (lx·s = lm·s·m^−2^).
