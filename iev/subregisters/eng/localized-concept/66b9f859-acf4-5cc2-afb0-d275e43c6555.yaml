  definition: law giving the force between two charged particles, expressed by the
    relation `F_((12)) = k * ((Q_1 Q_2))/((r^2)) * ((r_((21))))/(r) = k * ((Q_1 Q_2))/((r^2))
    * e_((21))` where `*F*`~12~ is the force exerted on the particle with electric
    charge `Q`~1~ by the particle with electric charge `Q`~2~ , `k` a positive constant,
    `*r*`~21~ the vector from the particle with electric charge `Q`~2~ to the particle
    with electric charge `Q`~1~, `r` = |`*r*`~21~| the distance between particles
    and `*e*`~21~ the unit vector `*r*`~21~/`r`

  notes:
  - In vacuum the constant `k` is equal to 1/4π`ε`~0~ where `ε`~0~ is the electric
    constant.
