  definition: at each point of a given space region, vector *`U`*, the rotation of
    which is the vector *`V`* of a given solenoidal field *`V`* = *rot `U`*

  notes:
  - The given vector field is said to be derived from the vector potential.
  - The vector potential is not unique since any irrotational field can be added to
    a given vector potential without changing its rotation. The vector potential is
    often chosen so that its divergence is zero.
  - The vector potential is used, for example, to represent the magnetic vector potential
    (*`A`*), the rotation of which is the magnetic flux density (*`B`*).
