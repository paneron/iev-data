  definition: effective photobiological radiance with the spectral radiance, `Lλ`,
    spectrally weighted with the blue light hazard spectral weighting function, `B`(`λ`)

  notes:
  - The wavelength range for the blue light hazard radiance is specified in ICNIRP-recommendations
    as `λ` = 300 nm to `λ` = 700 nm.
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which actinic action spectrum is used, as the unit
    is the same for any action spectrum.
  - The blue light hazard radiance is expressed in watt per square metre per steradian
    (W·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
