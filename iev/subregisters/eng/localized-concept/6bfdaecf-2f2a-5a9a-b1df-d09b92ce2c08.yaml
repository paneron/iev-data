  notes:
  - If a material is non-uniform or anisotropic, `J`~cm~ differs from the transport
    critical current density, `J`~ct~.
  - '`J`~cm~ takes sometimes smaller values than `J`~ct~ because of the different
    electric field strength due to the flux creep especially for high temperature
    superconductors.'
