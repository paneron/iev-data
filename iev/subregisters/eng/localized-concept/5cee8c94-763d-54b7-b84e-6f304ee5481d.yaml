  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the transfer of heat by forced
    convection in a fluid, defined by `S t = (K)/((rho v c_p))`, where `K` is the
    coefficient of heat transfer, `ρ` is mass density, `v` is fluid speed, and `c`~`p`~
    is specific heat capacity at constant pressure

  notes:
  - The Stanton number is the ratio of Nusselt number `Nu` to Péclet number `Pe`,
    thus `St` = `Nu`/`Pe`. It is combined with the Prandtl number in the heat transfer
    factor ({{113-04-55, IEV:113-04-55}}).
