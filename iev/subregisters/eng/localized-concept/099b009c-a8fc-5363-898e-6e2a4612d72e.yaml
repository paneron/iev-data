  notes:
  - In a graphical representation it is the value corresponding to any intersection
    with `H`-axis of the magnetization curve (for flux density, polarization or magnetization).
  - The coercive field strength may refer to the static or dynamic magnetization.
    When unqualified, the static curve is assumed.
