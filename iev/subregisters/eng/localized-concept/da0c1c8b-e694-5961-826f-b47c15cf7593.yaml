  notes:
  - 'The minimal erythema dose is a subjective measure based on the reddening of the
    skin; it depends on many variables, e.g. individual sensitivity to <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet
    radiation</a>, radiometric characteristics of the source, skin pigmentation, anatomic
    site, elapsed time between irradiation and observation of the reddening (typical
    value: 24 h). Since the minimal erythema dose varies with each individual, the
    use of this quantity should be reserved solely for observational studies in humans
    and other animals.'
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-26-069">standard erythema dose</a>".
  - The minimal erythema dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^).
