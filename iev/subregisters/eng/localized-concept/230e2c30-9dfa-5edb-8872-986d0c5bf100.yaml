  notes:
  - Every non-zero real or complex number has two square roots, each being the negative
    of the other. For a non-negative real number `a`, the non-negative square root
    is denoted by `a^(1 // 2)` or `sqrt(a)`. For a negative real number `a`, the number
    `- a` is positive and the two square roots are imaginary numbers, conjugate of
    each others, denoted by `j sqrt(- a)` and `- j sqrt(- a)`. For a complex number
    `c = | c | e^(j phi)`, the two square roots are `sqrt(| c |) e^(j phi // 2)` and
    `sqrt(| c |) e^(j ( (phi)/(2) + pi ))`.
  - The concept of square root may be applied to scalar quantities.
