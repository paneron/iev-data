  notes:
  - Reciprocity can exist within a {{multilateral arrangement, IEV:902-06-09}} comprising
    a network of bilateral reciprocal relationships.
  - Although rights and obligations are the same, opportunities emanating from them
    can differ; this can lead to unequal relationships between parties.
