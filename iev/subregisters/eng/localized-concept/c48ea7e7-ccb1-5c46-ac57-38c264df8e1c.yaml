  notes:
  - In the case of non-repairable items with an exponential distribution of operating
    times to failure (i.e. a constant failure rate) the MTTF is numerically equal
    to the reciprocal of the failure rate. This is also true for repairable items
    if after restoration they can be considered to be "as-good-as-new".
  - See also operating time to failure ({{192-05-01, IEV:192-05-01}}).
