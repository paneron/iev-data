  notes:
  - Temperature can be ranked using various quantity-value scales such as Celsius
    and Fahrenheit. All these scales are now tight to thermodynamic temperature scale.
  - 2 Thermodynamic temperature is one of the seven base quantities in the International
    System of Quantities, ISQ, on which the International System of Units, SI, is
    based. The coherent SI unit of thermodynamic temperature is kelvin, K (see IEC 60050-112:2010,
    112-02-08). The triple point of water has the thermodynamic temperature 273,16 K.
