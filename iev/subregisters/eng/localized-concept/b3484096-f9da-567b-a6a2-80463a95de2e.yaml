  definition: vector quantity equal to the integral of force *`F`* with respect to
    time `t`, thus `I = int_(t_1)^(t_2) F d t` over a time interval [`t`~1~, `t`~2~]

  notes:
  - 1 For a time interval &amp;lsqb;`t`~1~, `t`~2~&amp;rsqb;, impulse is equal to
    the change of momentum *`p`*, thus *`I`* = *`p`*(`t`~2~) − *`p`*(`t`~1~) = Δ *`p`*.
  - 2 In French, the term "impulsion" has also another meaning corresponding to English
    "pulse".
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of impulse is newton second, N⋅s.
