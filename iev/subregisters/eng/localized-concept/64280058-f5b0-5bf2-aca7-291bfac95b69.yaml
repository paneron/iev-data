  definition: '{{signal, IEV:171-01-03}} in which the characteristic carrying information
    can assume only {{discrete values, IEV:171-01-06}}, generally one value within
    each interval of a number of adjacent intervals of values'
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The adjacent intervals are contiguous without gaps, do not overlap and need not
    have the same size.
  - A discrete-value signal can be a {{continuous-time signal, IEV:171-01-10}}, as
    a quantized signal, or a {{discretely timed signal, IEV:171-01-12}}, and then
    a {{digital signal, IEV:171-01-13}}.
