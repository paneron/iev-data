  definition: quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-050">luminance</a> at a surface element
    of a medium in a given direction and the <a href="IEV845-21-060">illuminance</a>
    on the medium `q_v = ((L_v))/((E_v))` where `L`~v~ is luminance and `E`~v~ is
    illuminance

  notes:
  - The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is similar to the
    luminance coefficient except that it is defined for directional incident radiation.
  - The luminance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus one (sr^âˆ’1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-71 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
