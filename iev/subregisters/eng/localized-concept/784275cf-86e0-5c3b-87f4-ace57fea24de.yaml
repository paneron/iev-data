  notes:
  - The subject field of conformity assessment includes activities defined elsewhere
    in ISO/IEC 17000, such as {{testing, IEV:902-03-02}}, {{inspection, IEV:902-03-03}}
    and {{certification, IEV:902-04-05}}, as well as the {{accreditation, IEV:902-04-06}}
    of {{conformity assessment bodies, IEV:902-01-05}}.
  - The expression “object of conformity assessment” or “object” is used in ISO/IEC
    17000 to encompass any particular material, product, installation, process, system,
    person or body to which conformity assessment is applied. A service is covered
    by the definition of a product (see Note 1 to {{IEV 902-02-03, IEV:902-02-03}}).
