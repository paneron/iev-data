  definition: scalar potential of an irrotational magnetic field strength
  examples: []

  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The negative of the gradient of the scalar magnetic potential is the irrotational
    magnetic field strength.
  - The scalar magnetic potential is not unique since any constant scalar quantity
    can be added to a given scalar magnetic potential without changing its gradient.
