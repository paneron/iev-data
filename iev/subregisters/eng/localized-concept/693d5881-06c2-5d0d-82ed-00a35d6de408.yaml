  definition: 'for a magnetic core operating within the Rayleigh region, and having
    given geometry and material properties, the magnetic path length, the cross-sectional
    area and the volume that a hypothetical toroidal core of the same material properties
    and of radially thin uniform cross-section should possess to be magnetically equivalent
    to the given core Note 1 – The effective dimensions are as follows: effective
    cross-sectional area `A_e = ((C_1))/((C_2))` effective magnetic path length, `l_e
    = ((C_1^2))/((C_2))` effective volume, `V_e = ((C_1^3))/((C_2^2))` where `C`~1~
    and `C`~2~ are the appropriate core factors hence: `C_1 = ((l_e))/((A_e))` `C_2
    = ((l_e))/((A_e^2))` `V_e = l_e A_e` Note 2 – These formulae can also apply to
    a magnetic circuit operating outside the limit of the Rayleigh region provided
    the magnetization can be assumed to be uniform, for example as in an Epstein square.'
