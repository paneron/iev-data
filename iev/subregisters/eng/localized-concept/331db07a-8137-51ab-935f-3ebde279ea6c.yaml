  definition: 'scalar quantity equal to the line integral of the magnetic field strength
    `*H*` along a specified path linking two points a and b: `V_((m ,ab)) = int_((r_a))^((r_b))
    H * d r` where `*r*`~a~ and `*r*`~b~ are the position vectors for a and b, respectively,
    and d`*r*` is the vector line element'
