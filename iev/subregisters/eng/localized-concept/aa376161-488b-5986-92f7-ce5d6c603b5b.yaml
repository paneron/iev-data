  definition: 'macroscopic quantum effect in which, when a voltage `U` is applied
    across a Josephson junction, an alternating current of Cooper pairs flows by tunnelling
    through the junction, generating the emission of electromagnetic radiation having
    a frequency `f` proportional to the applied voltage: `f` = `K`~j~`U` where `K`~j~
    = 2`e`/`h` is the Josephson constant, with `e` being the elementary electric charge
    and `h` the Planck constant'

  notes:
  - The alternating-current Josephson effect also manifests itself conversely so that,
    when a Josephson junction is irradiated by electromagnetic radiation of frequency
    `f`, the voltage across it can assume quantized values equal to `nf`/`K`~j~, where
    `n` is a positive integer.
  - The value of the Josephson constant is 483 597,891(12) Ã— 10^9^ Hz V^-1^ (CODATA,
    2006).
