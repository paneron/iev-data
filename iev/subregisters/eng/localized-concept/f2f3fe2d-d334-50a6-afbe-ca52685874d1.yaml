  definition: quotient of d`EΔ` by d`l`, where d`EΔ` is the energy lost by a charged
    particle due to electronic collisions in traversing a distance d`l,` minus the
    sum of the kinetic energies of all the electrons released with kinetic energies
    in excess of threshold energy delta `LΔ` = (d`EΔ`/d`l`)
