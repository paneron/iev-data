  notes:
  - Performance index is a mathematical expression which characterises the quality
    of control under given conditions.
  - 'The determination of optimal control parameters frequently results from minimising
    integral criteria which are often called control areas from the geometric interpretation
    of the integral. The most important ones are:


    `I_((IAE)) = int_0^(oo) | e ( t ) | * d t` Criterion of Integral Absolute Error


    `I_((ISE)) = int_0^(oo) e^2 ( t ) * d t` Criterion of Integral Squared Error


    `I_((ITAE)) = int_0^(oo) t * | e ( t ) | * d t` Criterion of Integral of Time
    multiplied Absolute value of Error


    Therein `e`(`t`) is the control difference variable as a function of time as answer
    to an input appropriate to the technological task, for example a response to a
    stepwise change of the reference variable.'
