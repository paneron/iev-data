  definition: . function `f ( t )` which is a measure of the similarity of two deterministic
    functions `f_1 ( t )` and `f_2 ( t )`, defined by `f ( t ) = int_( - oo)^( + oo)
    f_1 ( tau ) f_2 ( t + tau ) d tau` . function `f ( t )` which is a measure of
    the similarity of two stationary random functions `f_1 ( t )` and `f_2 ( t )`,
    defined by `f ( t ) = underset((T -> oo))((lim)) (1)/((2 T)) int_( - T)^( + T)
    f_1 ( tau ) f_2 ( t + tau ) d tau`

  notes:
  - 'The Fourier transform of `f ( t )` is equal to the product of the conjugate of
    the Fourier transform of `f_1 ( t )` and the Fourier transform of `f_2 ( t )`:


    `F ( omega ) = F_1^( ** ) ( omega ) F_2 ( omega )`'
