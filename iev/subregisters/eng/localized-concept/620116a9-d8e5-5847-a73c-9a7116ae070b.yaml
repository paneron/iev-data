  definition: representation of a sinusoidal {{integral quantity, IEV:131-11-01}}
    by a complex quantity whose argument is equal to the initial phase and whose modulus
    is equal to the {{RMS value, IEV:103-02-03}}

  notes:
  - For a quantity `a ( t ) = hat A cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )` the phasor is `underset(_)(A)
    = A exp ( j vartheta_0 )`, where `A = (hat A)/((sqrt(2)))` is the RMS value and
    `vartheta_0` is the initial phase. A phasor can also be represented graphically.
  - Electric current phasor `underset(_)(I)` and voltage phasor `underset(_)(U)` are
    often used.
  - The similar representation with the modulus equal to the amplitude is sometimes
    also called "phasor".
