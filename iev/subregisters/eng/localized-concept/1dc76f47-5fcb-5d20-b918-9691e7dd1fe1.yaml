  definition: 1) for a discrete random variable `X` taking the values `xi` with the
    probabilities `pi`, the sum `E`(`X`) = ∑`i` `pixi` extended to all values `xi`
    which can be taken by `X` 2) for a continuous random variable `X` having the probability
    density function `f`(`x`), the value of the integral `E`(`X`) = ∫`xf(x)`d`x`
