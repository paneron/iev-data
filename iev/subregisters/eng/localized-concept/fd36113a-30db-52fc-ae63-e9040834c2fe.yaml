  definition: scalar constant `ε`~0~ linking the electric quantities and the mechanical
    quantities, obtained from the relation `F = (1)/((4 pi epsilon_0)) * ((| Q_1 Q_2
    |))/((r^2))` based on Coulomb's law in vacuum, where `F` is the magnitude of the
    force between two particles with electric charges `Q`~1~ and `Q`~2~ respectively,
    placed at a distance `r` apart

  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the product of the electric constant and the electric field strength
    *`E`*  is equal to the electric flux density *`D`*:


    *`D`* = `ε`~0~*`E`*'
  - 'The electric constant is related to the magnetic constant `μ`~0~ and to the speed
    of light in vacuum `c`~0~ by the relation


    `ε`~0~`μ`~0~`c`~0~^2^ = 1'
  - 'The value of the electric constant is exactly equal to


    `((10^7))/((4 pi xx 299 792 458^2)) m^(- 3) kg^(- 1) s^4 A^2 = 8 , 854 187 817
    ... pF // m`'
