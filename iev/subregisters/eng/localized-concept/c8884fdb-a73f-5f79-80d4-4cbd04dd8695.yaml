  definition: 'a measure of the relative difference in refractive index of the core
    and the cladding of an optical fibre, given by: `Delta = ((n_1^2 - n_2^2))/((2
    n_1^2))` where `n`~1~ and `n`~2~ are, respectively, the maximum in the core and
    the refractive index of the innermost homogeneous cladding'
