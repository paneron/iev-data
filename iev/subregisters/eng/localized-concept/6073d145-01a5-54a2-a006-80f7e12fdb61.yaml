  notes:
  - 'These levels may be two logic levels `V`~OL~ and `V`~OH~ or 10 % to 90 % of its
    maximum amplitude (`V`~HI~ – `V`~LO~), or any other ratio defined in the detail
    specification


    where


    `V`~OL~  is the low level output voltage


    `V`~OH~  is the high level output voltage


    `V`~HI~  is the upper flat voltage of the pulse waveform


    `V`~LO~  is the low flat voltage of the pulse waveform.'
