  notes:
  - The scattering matrix is the array of the coefficients of the linear equations
    which express the normalized complex wave amplitudes of the transmitted wave and
    the reflected wave at each port 1, 2, i, ... `n` considered as an output port
    in terms of the normalized complex wave amplitudes of the incident waves to the
    ports 1, 2, j, ... `n` considered as input ports.
