  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists only
    in an unsymmetrical three-phase system of sinusoidal quantities and which is defined
    by the following complex mathematical expression: `X`~0~ = 1/3 (`X`~L1~ + `X`~L2~
    + `X`~L3~) where `X`~L1~, `X`~L2~ and `X`~L3~ are the complex expressions of the
    phase quantities concerned, and where `X` denotes the system current or voltage
    phasors'
