  definition: for a linear passive two-terminal-pair network, each of the impedances
    `Z`~i1~ and `Z`~i2~ where the input impedance at port 1 is `Z`~i1~ when the terminating
    impedance of port 2 is `Z`~i2~ and the input impedance at port 2 is `Z`~i2~ when
    the terminating impedance of port 1 is `Z`~i1~
