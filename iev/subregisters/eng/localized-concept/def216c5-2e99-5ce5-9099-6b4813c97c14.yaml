  notes:
  - This Type of Protection cannot prevent the surrounding explosive gas atmosphere
    from penetrating into the equipment and components and being ignited by the circuits.
    However, due to the small free volumes in the filling material and due to the
    quenching of a flame that can propagate through the paths in the filling material,
    an external explosion is prevented.
