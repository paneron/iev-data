    purposes, established for the operating condition in which the electric current

    the connector is maintained at 40 Â°C

  notes:
  - If other ambient temperatures are used for the definition of rated connector current,
    the specification should state in the ambient temperature on which the rating
    is based, with reference, if appropriate, to the rating curve defined in IEC 60512,
    test 5b.
