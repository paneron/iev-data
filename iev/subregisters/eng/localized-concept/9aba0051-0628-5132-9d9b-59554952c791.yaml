  definition: for a polyphase line consisting of `m` line conductors and one neutral
    conductor, sum of the `m` instantaneous powers expressed for each line conductor
    by the product of the polyphase line-to-neutral voltage and the corresponding
    line current
  examples: []

  notes:
  - If there is no neutral conductor, the voltages between the line conductors and
    any reference point have to be used instead of the polyphase line-to-neutral voltages.
