  definition: quotient of the real difference in luminance between the target and
    its background, Δ`L`, and the luminance difference needed between a target of
    a certain angular size and its background for the target to be just visible, Δ`L`~th~,
    that is at the threshold `F`~VL~ = Δ`L` / Δ`L`~th~

  notes:
  - The visibility level indicates how much the contrast of the target is above threshold
    contrast.
  - The visibility level has unit one.
