  definition: 'the fractional change of inductance due to a change in temperature
    divided by that change in temperature: `alpha_L = ((L_(theta) - L_((ref))))/((L_((ref))
    ( theta - theta_((ref)) )))` where `Lθ` and `L`~ref~ are the inductances at temperatures
    `θ` and `θ`~ref~ respectively'
