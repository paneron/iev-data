  definition: for a radionuclide emitting photons, the quotient of `l^2 overset(˙)(K)_(delta)`
    by `A`, where `Kδ` is the air kerma-rate due to photons of energy greater than
    δ, at a distance 1 from a point source of this nuclide having an activity `A`
    `Gamma_(delta) = ((l^2 overset(˙)(K)_(delta)))/(A)`

  notes:
  - 'The SI unit of air kerma-rate constant is m^2^ • J • kg^−1^.


    When the special names gray (Gy) and becquerel (Bq) are used m^2^ • J • kg^−1^
    becomes m^2^ • Gy • Bq^−1^ • s^−1^.


    When the earlier special units of activity (the curie) and kerma (the rad) are
    used


    `1 rad * m^2 * Ci^(- 1) * s^(- 1) = ((10^(- 12)))/((3,7)) m^2 * J * kg^(- 1) (
    exactly )`'
