  definition: 'a graded index profile with the square of refractive index in the core
    decreasing according to a law involving a power of the distance from the axis.
    `n`^2^ (`r`) = `n`^2^~1~ [1 – 2 Δ (`r` / `а`)^g^] `r` ≤ `a` where : `n`(`r`) is
    the refractive index as a function of radius, `n`~1~ is the refractive index on
    axis, `a` is the core radius, `g` is a parameter that defines the shape of the
    profile and Δ is a parameter which is the same as the refractive index contrast
    when the refractive index of the cladding is constant'
