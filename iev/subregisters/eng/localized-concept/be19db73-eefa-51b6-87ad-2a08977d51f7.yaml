  notes:
  - These are sometimes called "relevant ignition sources", however this can lead
    to misunderstanding as to whether the ignition source is relevant in terms of
    it being present, in terms of its ignition capability or in terms of whether it
    is present in the equipment or not.
  - All equipment related ignition sources are considered in the ignition hazard assessment
    to determine whether they are potential ignition sources.
