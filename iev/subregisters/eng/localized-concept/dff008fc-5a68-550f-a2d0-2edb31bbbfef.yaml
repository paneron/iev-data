  definition: passive `n`-terminal circuit element characterized by `n` − 1 functional
    relations between the voltages ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between each of
    `n` − 1 terminals and the remaining terminal, and the electric charges ({{131-12-11,
    IEV:131-12-11}}) at these `n` − 1 terminals
  examples: []

  notes:
  - The electric energy absorbed by a capacitive n-terminal element is stored in electrostatic
    form and is completely recoverable.
