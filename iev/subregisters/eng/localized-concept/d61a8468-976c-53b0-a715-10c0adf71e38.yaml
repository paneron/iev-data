  definition: . for a discrete random variable `X` taking the values `x_i` with the
    probabilities `p_i`, the sum `E ( X ) = sum_i p_i x_i` extended for all values
    `x_i` which can be taken by `X` . for a continuous random variable `X` having
    the probability density function `f ( x )`, the value of the integral `E ( X )
    = int x f ( x ) d x` extended for all values of the interval of variation of `X`
