  definition: symbolic notation expressed formally as a vector, used to denote scalar
    or vector differential operators operating at each point of a given space region
    on scalars or vectors, and which, in orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, is represented
    by `grad = e_x ( del )/((del x)) + e_y ( del )/((del y)) + e_z ( del )/((del z))`
    where `e_x , e_y , e_z` are unit vectors along the `x`, `y`, `z` axes
