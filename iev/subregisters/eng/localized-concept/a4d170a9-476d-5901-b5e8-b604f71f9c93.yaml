  definition: 'scalar quantity equal to the line integral of a vector quantity along
    a path C from point a to point b in which charge carriers can be displaced: `U_i
    = int_((r_a ( C )))^((r_b)) ( - ((del A))/((del t)) + v xx B ) * d r` where *`A`*
    and *`B`* are respectively a magnetic vector potential and the magnetic flux density
    at a point of the path, `v` is the velocity with which that point is moving, *`r`*
    is position vector, and `t` is time'

  notes:
  - The induced voltage is equal to the time derivative of the linked flux corresponding
    to the path, with the positive or negative signs according to the convention in
    IEC 60375.
