  notes:
  - The stack test involves variables that can be related to individual cells (temperature,
    voltage) or the whole stack (such as temperature, {{current density, IEV:485-12-01}},
    fuel and oxidant flow rates, etc.) and adjusted in order to obtain data over a
    wide range of conditions. The outcome of a stack test can be a {{polarization
    curve, IEV:485-15-06}}, a {{single cell, IEV:485-05-02}}'s voltages stability
    plot, or other data related to fuel cell performance.
