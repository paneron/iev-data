  notes:
  - The virtual temperature is not necessarily the highest temperature in the device.
  - 'Based on the power dissipation and the thermal resistance or impedance that corresponds
    to the mode of operation, the virtual junction temperature can be calculated from
    the formula:


    `T_j = T_((case)) + (P)/((R_((th))))` or `T_j = T_((amb)) + (P)/((R_((th))))`'
