  definition: representation of a sinusoidal integral quantity by a complex quantity
    whose argument is equal to the initial phase and whose modulus is equal to the
    root-mean-square value ({{103-02-03, IEV:103-02-03}})

  notes:
  - For a quantity `a ( t ) = A sqrt(2) cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )` the phasor is
    `A exp j vartheta_0`. Electric current phasor `underset(_)(I)` and voltage phasor
    `underset(_)(U)` are often used.
  - The similar representation with the modulus equal to the amplitude is sometimes
    also called "phasor". See {{103-07-14, IEV:103-07-14}}.
  - A phasor can also be represented graphically.
