  notes:
  - The root-mean-square value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - For a sinusoidal quantity `a ( t ) = hat A cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )`, the
    root-mean-square value is `A_((eff)) = hat A // sqrt(2)`.
  - The root-mean-square value of a quantity may be denoted by adding one of the subscripts
    eff or rms to the symbol of the quantity.
  - In electrical technology, the root-mean-square values of electric current `i (
    t )` and voltage `u ( t )` are usually denoted `I` and `U`, respectively.
  - The abbreviation RMS was formerly denoted as r.m.s. or rms, but these notations
    are now deprecated.
