  definition: approximate form of Planck's law, valid with an approximation better
    than one part in 1 000 when the product `λT` is smaller than 0,002 m·K `L_((e
    , lambda)) ( lambda , T ) = ((c_1))/(pi) lambda^(- 5) e^(((c_2))/((lambda T)))`
    where `L`~e,~`λ` is spectral radiance, `λ` is the wavelength in vacuum, `T` is
    thermodynamic temperature, `c_1 \ = 2 \ pi \ h \ c_0^2`, `c_2 \ = h \ c_0 \ //
    \ k`, `h` is the Planck constant, `c`~0~ is the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}},
    and `k` is the Boltzmann constant

  notes:
  - The formula is sometimes written with `((c_1))/((pi omega_0))` instead of `((c_1))/(pi)`,
    where `Ω`~0~ is the solid angle of magnitude 1 sr.
  - For a detector in a medium of refractive index `n`, the measured radiance is `n`^−2^`L`~e,~`λ`(`λ`,
    `T`).
  - Wien's law can also be expressed to give the approximate <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral
    distribution</a> of radiant exitance `M`~e,~`λ`(`λ`, `T`); the first factor in
    the formula is then `c`~1~ instead of `((c_1))/(pi)`.
  - The quantities radiance (as referred to in Note 2 to entry) and radiant exitance
    (as referred to in Note  3 to entry) apply to the <a href="IEV845-21-021">unpolarized
    radiation</a> as emitted.
