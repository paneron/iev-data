  definition: ratio of the vertical dimension (height) to the horizontal dimension
    (width) of a three-dimensional structure, used as an index of the relative thickness
    of the structure

  notes:
  - It is accepted that the silicon process is not appropriate to form three-dimensional
    structures of much depth, because it is difficult to manufacture structures having
    an aspect ratio over 10. By the use of {{anisotropic etching, IEV:523-05-09}}
    or the {{LIGA process, IEV:523-05-06}}, deep holes, grooves and so on having an
    aspect ratio of 100 or greater can be obtained.
