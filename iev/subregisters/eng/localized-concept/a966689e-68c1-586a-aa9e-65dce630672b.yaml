  definition: 'scalar potential `V` of the irrotational vector `( E + ((del A))/((del
    t)) )`, where `*E*` is the electric field strength, `*A*` is a magnetic vector
    potential and `t` is the time: `- grad V = E + ((del A))/((del t))`'

  notes:
  - The electric potential is not unique since any constant scalar quantity can be
    added to a given electric potential without changing its gradient.
