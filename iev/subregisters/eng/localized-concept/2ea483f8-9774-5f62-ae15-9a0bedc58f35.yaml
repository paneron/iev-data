  notes:
  - 'Cylindrical illuminance is sometimes also defined as the arithmetic mean of the
    vertical illuminance `E`~v,v~ at a point


    `E_((v ,c)) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_0^((2 pi)) E_((v ,v)) d phi`


    where `E`~v,v~ is the vertical illuminance for an area element with its normal
    in the direction `φ`, and `φ` is the angle in the plane perpendicular to the axis
    of the cylinder.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "cylindrical irradiance". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon cylindrical irradiance".
  - The cylindrical illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
