  definition: phenomenon in which a superconducting state appears within about one
    coherence length from the surface of a material even under a magnetic field strength
    above the upper critical field strength, `H`~c2~

  notes:
  - If the magnetic field is parallel to the surface of the sample, surface superconductivity
    appears within a range of a magnetic field strength from `H`~c2~ to `H`~c`3`~
    = 1,695 `H`~c2~ for type II superconductors and from `H`~c~ to `H`~c3~ = 2,40
    `H`~c~ for type I superconductors.
