  definition: density of exiting luminous flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface `M_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d A))` where `Φ`~v~ is luminous
    flux and `A` is the area from which the luminous flux leaves

  notes:
  - 'Luminous exitance can be derived from the spectral radiant exitance distribution
    by


    `M_v = K_m int_0^(oo) M_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda`


    where `K`~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, `M`~e,~`λ`(`λ`) is the spectral radiant
    exitance at wavelength `λ` and `V`(`λ`) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous
    efficiency</a>.


    Integral limits can be confined depending on the spectral <a href="IEV845-25-061">responsivity</a>
    of the detectors used as a sensor.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exitance". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exitance".
  - The luminous exitance is expressed in lumen per square metre (lm·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-48 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
