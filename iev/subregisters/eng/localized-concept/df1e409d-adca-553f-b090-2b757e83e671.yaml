  notes:
  - Dissipative materials or objects are neither conductive nor insulating but, like
    conductive items, safely limit contact charging and/or dissipate even the maximum
    charging currents associated with their designed application when in contact with
    the earth.
  - 'Boundary limits for the dissipative range for solid materials, enclosures, some
    objects and for bulk materials are given in IEC TS 60079-32-1, _Explosive atmospheres
    â€“ Part 32-1: Electrostatic hazards, guidance_.'
  - Product standards often include specific definitions of "dissipative" which apply
    only to items covered by those standards and can be different to the definitions
    given here.
