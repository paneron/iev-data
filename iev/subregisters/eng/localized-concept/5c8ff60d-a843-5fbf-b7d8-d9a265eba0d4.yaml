  notes:
  - Spatial brightness can be perceived while immersed within a space or when a space
    is observed remotely but fills a large part of the visual field.
  - Spatial brightness does not necessarily relate to the brightness of any individual
    objects or surfaces in the environment, but can be influenced by the brightness
    of these individual items.
