  notes:
  - The loss of an echo path is usually frequency-dependent, and its contribution
    to the echo reference equivalent is determined by frequency weighting, described
    in the section B.5 of the annex B of the CCITT Recommendation G.122 from the fascicule
    III.1 of the Red Book, 1985.
