  definition: lowest voltage at which partial discharges are initiated in the test
    arrangement when the voltage applied to the test object is gradually increased
    from a lower value at which no such discharges are observed

  notes:
  - With sinusoidal applied voltage, the partial discharge inception voltage is defined
    as the r.m.s. value of the voltage. With impulse voltages, the partial discharge
    inception voltage is defined as the peak-to-peak voltage.
