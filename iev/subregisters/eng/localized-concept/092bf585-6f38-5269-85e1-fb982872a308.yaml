  notes:
  - There are many examples of micropumps mainly fabricated on silicon or glass, for
    instance, and using micromachining technology to form a diaphragm together with
    an {{actuator, IEV:151-13-49}}. Application examples include a diaphragm-type
    pump with a microscopic check valve driven by a piezoelectric element, and an
    integrated pump using a thermal expansion actuator along with a microheater. Pumps
    discharging and sucking fluids by deforming a diaphragm actuated by a stacked
    {{piezoelectric actuator, IEV:523-04-10}} can control the rate by changing the
    frequency of the actuator drive. In addition, pulsation-damping pumps can control
    the fluid flow with a high accuracy by using a dual pump along with a synchronous
    buffer pump.
