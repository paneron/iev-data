  definition: for a non-zero complex number `c`, the real number `Ï†` restricted to
    `- pi phi <= pi`, such that `c = | c | e^(j phi)`

  notes:
  - 'The argument `arg c` of the complex number `c = a + j b = | c | e^(j phi)` is
    equal to:

    `arccos ( a // sqrt(a^2 + b^2) )` if `b &gt;= 0` and `- arccos ( a // sqrt(a^2
    + b^2) )` if `b 0`, where `0 &lt;= arccos x &lt;= pi`.

    It is not defined if `a = b = 0`.'
  - The concept of argument may be applied to complex scalar quantities.
