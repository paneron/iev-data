  definition: for a square matrix *`A`* of order `n` with the elements `Aij`, scalar
    denoted by det *`A`*, equal to the algebraic sum of the products obtained by taking
    as factors in all possible ways one and only one element from each row and each
    column, each product with the sign plus or minus depending whether the total number
    of inversions of the two subscripts is even or odd `det A = underset(sigma)( sum
    ) ( - 1 )^(epsilon ( sigma )) A_((1 sigma ( 1 ))) A_((2 sigma ( 2 ))) ... A_((n
    sigma ( n )))` where `σ` = (`σ`(1), `σ`(2), …, `σ`(`n`)) is a permutation of the
    subscripts (1, 2, …, `n`), `ε`(`σ`) is the number of inversions in permutation
    `σ`, and the sum denoted by Σ is for all permutations

  notes:
  - The determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of the `n` vectors, the
    coordinates of which are the elements of the rows or of the columns.
  - The determinant of the matrix `A = ( [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1 n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((n
    1)),cdots,A_((n n))]] )` is denoted *`A`* or `| [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1 n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((n
    1)),cdots,A_((n n))]] |`.
