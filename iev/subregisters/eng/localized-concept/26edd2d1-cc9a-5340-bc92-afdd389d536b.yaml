  definition: energy due to the position in a force field, equal to the opposite of
    the line integral along a curve C of a conservative force *`F`*, thus `V = - int_C
    F * d r`, where d*`r`* is vector line element

  notes:
  - 1 A force is conservative when the force field *`F`*(*`r`*) is static and irrotational,
    i.e. *rot* *`F`* = *0*, in a simply connected domain.
  - 2 Force *`F`* is the gradient of potential energy `V`, thus *`F`* = *grad* `V`.
