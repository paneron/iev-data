  definition: relative decrease in radiant flux caused by absorption and scattering,
    expressed by the relative density of the spectral radiant flux, `Φ`~e,~`λ`(`λ`),
    with respect to propagation length, `l`, of a collimated beam at a point in an
    absorbing and scattering medium `mu ( lambda ) = (1)/((Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda
    ))) ((d Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda )))/((d l))`

  notes:
  - The spectral linear attenuation coefficient is expressed in metre to the power
    minus one (m^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-76 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
