  definition: under sinusoidal conditions, circuit-theory theorem stating that, when
    the value of the impedance of a branch of a passive linear network is changed,
    the electric current change in any branch is equal to the current that would be
    produced by a source voltage inserted in the modified branch, the value of which
    is the product of the current in this branch before the impedance is changed by
    the impedance change

  - The compensation theorem can be generalized to non-sinusoidal conditions.
