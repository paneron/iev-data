  definition: 'three empirical laws that describe colour-matching properties of additive
    mixtures of colour stimuli: * to specify a colour match, three independent variables
    are necessary and sufficient, * for an additive mixture of colour stimuli, only
    their tristimulus values are relevant, not their spectral compositions, * in an
    additive mixture of colour stimuli, if one or more components of the mixture are
    gradually changed, the resulting tristimulus values also change gradually'
