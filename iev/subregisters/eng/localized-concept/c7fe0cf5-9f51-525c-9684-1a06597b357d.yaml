  definition: operation performed on a set for which an addition is defined, usually
    denoted by the minus symbol −, the result of which, for elements `a` and `b` of
    the set, is the unique element `a` − `b`, if it exists in the set, such that `b`
    + (`a` − `b`) = `a`

  notes:
  - Subtraction is defined for integers and extended to other classes of numbers and
    to mathematical entities such as vectors and matrices, and also to quantities
    of the same kind.
  - The subtraction of entities `a` and `b` can be defined by `a` − `b` = `a` + (−`b`)
    where −`b` is the negative of `b`.
  - The subtraction of entities `a` and `b` is expressed by the words "`a` minus `b`".
