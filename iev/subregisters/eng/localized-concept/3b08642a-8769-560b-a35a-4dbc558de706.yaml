    layer on which it is incident vertically

  notes:
  - There is usually one critical frequency for each magneto-ionic component
  - The critical frequency for the ordinary wave is the plasma frequency corresponding
    to the maximum electron density of the layer.
  - 'The critical frequencies for the ordinary wave and the extraordinary wave are
    respectively represented by the symbols `f`~o~ and `f`~x~, followed by the designation
    of the layer, for example: `f`~o~F2.'
