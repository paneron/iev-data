  definition: the quotient of d`E`~tr~/`E`~`N`~ by `ρ` d`l`, where `E`~`N`~ is the
    energy of each particle (excluding rest energy), `N` is the number of particles,
    and d`E`~tr~/`E`~`N`~ is the fraction of incident particle energy that is transferred
    to kinetic energy of charged particles by interactions in traversing a distance
    d`l` in the material of density `ρ` `((mu_((tr))))/(rho) = (1)/((E_N rho)) * ((d
    E_((tr))))/((d l))`

  - 'For a given monoenergetic radiation, the relationship between kerma (`K`) and
    energy fluence (`Ψ`) may be written
