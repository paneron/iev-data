  definition: 'the current in a device when further increase in voltage produces practically
    no increase in current. Examples: 1) In an ionization chamber: the electric current
    which results when the applied potential is sufficient to collect practically
    all ions. 2) In an X-ray tube: the electric current in the tube when practically
    all emitted electrons reach the anode.'
