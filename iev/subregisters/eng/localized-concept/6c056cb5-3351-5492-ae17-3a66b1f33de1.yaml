  notes:
  - 'The Sabine reverberation-time equation is:


    `T = ((( 24 ln 10 ) V))/((c A)) = ((55,3))/((c A)) V`


    where:


    `T` is the reverberation time, in seconds


    `V` is the volume of the room, in cubic metres


    `c` is the speed of sound in the air contained in the room, in metres per second


    `A` is the sum of all Sabine absorptions in the room, in decibel metre-squared.'
  - The unit of Sabine absorption is the decibel metre-squared, sometimes known as
    the metric sabin.
