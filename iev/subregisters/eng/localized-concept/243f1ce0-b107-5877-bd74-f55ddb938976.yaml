  definition: quotient of d`E`~tr~ by d`m` where d`E`~tr~ is the sum of the initial
    kinetic energies of all charged ionizing particles liberated by uncharged ionizing
    particles in a mass d`m` of material `K` = d`E`~tr~/d`m`

  notes:
  - The unit for kerma is gray (1 Gy = 1 J kg^−1^).
  - Kerma is derived from “kinetic energy released per unit mass”.
  - In the case where the material is air the name is air kerma.
  - This entry was numbered 393-14-65 in IEC 60050-393:2003.
