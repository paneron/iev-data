  definition: for two complex-valued functions, `underset(_)(f)` and `underset(_)(g)`,
    defined on the interval `a , b` of ℝ, complex number `〈 underset(_)(f) , underset(_)(g)
    〉 = int_a^b underset(_)(f) ( x ) underset(_)(g)^( ** ) ( x ) d x`, where `underset(_)(g)^(
    ** )` is the conjugate of `underset(_)(g)`

  notes:
  - 'The inner product has the following properties: `〈 underset(_)(f) , underset(_)(g)
    〉 = 〈 underset(_)(g) , underset(_)(f) 〉^( ** )` and `〈 underset(_)(alpha) underset(_)(f)
    + underset(_)(beta) underset(_)(g) , underset(_)(h) 〉 = underset(_)(alpha) 〈 underset(_)(f)
    , underset(_)(h) 〉 + underset(_)(beta) 〈 underset(_)(g) , underset(_)(h) 〉` where
    `underset(_)(alpha) , underset(_)(beta) in` ℂ.'
  - The inner product for complex functions is similar to the Hermitian product for
    vectors (see IEC 60050-102, {{102-03-18, IEV:102-03-18}}). For real functions,
    it is similar to the scalar product (see IEC 60050-102, {{102-03-17, IEV:102-03-17}}).
