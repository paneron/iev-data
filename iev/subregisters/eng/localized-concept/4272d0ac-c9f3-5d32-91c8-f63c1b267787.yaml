  definition: 'vector field quantity `*B*` which exerts on any charged particle having
    velocity `*v*` a force `*F*` equal to the product of the vector product `*v*`
    x `*B*` and the electric charge `Q` of the particle: `*F*` = `Q*v*` x `*B*`'

  notes:
  - 'The divergence of `*B*`  is zero at all points:


    div `*B*` = 0'
  - The magnetic flux density `*B*` is sometimes called “magnetic field”, risking
    confusion with the magnetic field strength `*H*` .
