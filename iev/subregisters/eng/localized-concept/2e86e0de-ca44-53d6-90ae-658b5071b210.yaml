  notes:
  - Failures (such as a breakdown of pump seals, flange gaskets or releases of substances
    caused by accidents) which involve repair or shut-down are not considered to be
    part of normal operation.
  - Minor releases of flammable material can be part of normal operation. For example,
    releases of substances from seals that rely on wetting by the fluid that is being
    pumped are considered to be minor releases.
