  notes:
  - In most actual applications of NTSC, the scanning system uses 525 lines and 60
    fields/second. The colour signal is transmitted using vestigial side band amplitude
    modulation, and the sound is transmitted as frequency modulation of a separate
    radio-frequency carrier.
  - The term NTSC is an abbreviation of "National Television System Committee".
