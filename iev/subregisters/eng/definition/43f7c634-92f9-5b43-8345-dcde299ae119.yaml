  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:705-01-13}} such that the {{electric field strength,
    IEV:121-11-18}} vector or a specified field vector rotates as a function of time
    in an anticlockwise sense in any fixed plane normal to the {{direction of propagation,
    IEV:705-02-15}} or to a specified reference direction, as seen by an observer
    looking in this direction'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reference direction shall be specified when the direction of propagation is
    parallel to the {{plane of polarization, IEV:705-01-22}}.
