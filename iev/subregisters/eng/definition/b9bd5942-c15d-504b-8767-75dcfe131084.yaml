  definition: 'the fractional change of permeability due to a change in temperature
    divided by that change in temperature:


    stem:[alpha_(mu) = ((mu_(theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_((ref)) ( theta - theta_((ref))
    )))]


    where stem:[µθ] and stem:[µ]~ref~ are the permeabilities at temperatures stem:[θ]
    and stem:[θ]~ref~ respectively'
