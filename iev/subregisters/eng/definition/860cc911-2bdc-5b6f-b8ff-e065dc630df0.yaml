  definition: domain wall in which the direction of the magnetic area moment varies
    through the wall but remains substantially in a plane perpendicular to the plane
    of the wall
  examples: []
  notes:
  - NÃ©el walls are normally formed only in thin films below a critical thickness;
    in thicker films and in bulk materials the formation of Bloch walls is favourable
    from energy considerations.
