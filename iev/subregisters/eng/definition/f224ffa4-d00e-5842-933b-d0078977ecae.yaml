  definition: the upper limit of the dose equivalent to the whole or part of the body
    or of effective dose equivalent, intended to prevent non-stochastic effects of
    ionizing radiation and to limit the occurrence of stochastic effects to an acceptable
    level
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Dose equivalent limits may be set for occupational or non-occupational exposure
    and different values may be specified for different groups within a population.
  - In applying dose equivalent limits, absorbed doses received from medical exposures
    or from normal exposure to natural radiation may be disregarded.
