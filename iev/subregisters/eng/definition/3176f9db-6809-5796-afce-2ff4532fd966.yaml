  notes:
  - The unit byte can be combined with SI prefixes, e.g. kilobyte (kB), or with binary
    prefixes, e.g. kibibyte (KiB). For binary multiples (powers of 2), the use of
    binary prefixes is recommended to avoid ambiguity.
  - The unit byte can be combined with other units, e.g. byte per second (B/s).
  - The unit symbol o is generally used in French.
