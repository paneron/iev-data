  definition: power absorbed from a time-varying electric field by a polarized substance,
    excluding absorbed power due to conductivity of the substance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The dielectric loss is usually dissipated as heat.
  - In 60050-121 dielectric loss is defined as power absorbed from a time-varying
    electric field by a polarized substance, excluding absorbed power due to the conductivity
    of the substance. In practice the loss due to the conduction current in the dielectric
    is usually included in the dielectric loss.
