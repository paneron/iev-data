    is reversed in successive layers.'
  - 'Parallel core cable: cable constructed with one or more cores of parallel-laid
    wires surrounded by one layer of helically laid wires.'
  - 'Unidirectional cable: all layers have a common direction of lay, with increase
    in length of lay for each successive layer.'
  - 'Unilay cable: all layers have a common length and direction of lay.'
