  definition: 'the ratio stem:[U]~d~/ stem:[U]~N~ (tapping factor) or 100 stem:[U]~d~/
    stem:[U]~N~ (tapping factor expressed as a percentage)


    where:


    stem:[U]~N~ is the rated voltage of the winding


    stem:[U]~d~ is the voltage which would be developed at no-load at the terminals
    of the winding, connected on the tapping concerned, by applying rated voltage
    to an untapped winding'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The tapping factor expresses the relative value of the "effective number of turns"
    of the tapped winding at the relevant tapping, the basis 1 being the effective
    number of turns of this winding at the principal tapping.
