  definition: random noise caused by the surface irregularity or granular nature of
    a medium through which an electric current flows
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Examples of irregular or granular media are: a junction between semiconductors,
    an oxide coated cathode and a granular resistor.'
  - Flicker noise has a continuous spectrum and its power spectral density is important
    only at very low frequencies where it approximates to 1/stem:[f] noise.
