  definition: helium at pressures, stem:[p], and/or temperature, stem:[T], above the
    critical point (stem:[p] &gt; 227 kPa, stem:[T] &gt; 5,2 K) which is characterized
    by zero latent heat of vaporization and a continuous density function
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In magnet cooling application, high pressure (&gt; 227 kPa) helium near 4,2 K
    is also called supercritical helium.
