  definition: '{{wafer, IEV:521-05-29}}-cutting technology using a laser light that
    is radiated and scanned along dicing lines on a {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a cutting process where blade dicing is difficult to use, the laser dicing
    method is widely used where a laser light is focused inside the substrate and
    modified layers are formed beneath the scribe lines, and finally the wafer is
    diced by a mechanical expansion.
