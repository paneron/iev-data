  definition: 'value of deceleration stem:[Î³]~e~ obtained by dividing the difference
    of the squares of the initial and final speeds by twice the distance travelled
    while the reduction of speed is taking place


    stem:[gamma_e = ((V_i^2 - V_t^2))/((2 l))]


    where

    stem:[l] is the distance between the position of the train or vehicle at the moment
    of the operation of the brake control and its position when the final speed is
    attained;


    stem:[V]~i~ is the initial speed measured at the moment of operation of the control
    device for the brake;

    stem:[V]~t~ is the final speed obtained at the end of the braking'
