    and reaching the receiving point along trajectories located in the strongly dispersive
    medium of the plasmasphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Whistlers occur generally at LF, VLF and ELF and usually include one or several
    components whose instantaneous frequencies decrease steadily in the audio-frequency
    range in a period of time varying from a fraction of second to several seconds.
