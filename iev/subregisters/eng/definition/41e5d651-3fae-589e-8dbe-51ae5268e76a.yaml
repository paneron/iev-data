  definition: limit of the ratio of the conditional probability that the instant of
    time, stem:[T], of a failure of a product falls within a given time interval (stem:[t],
    stem:[t] &amp;plus; Δstem:[t]) and the duration of this interval, Δstem:[t], when
    Δstem:[t] tends towards zero, given that the item is in an up state at the start
    of the time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For applications where distance travelled or number of cycles of operation is
    more relevant than time then the unit of time can be replaced by the unit of distance
    or cycles, as appropriate.
  - The term “failure rate” is often used in the sense of “mean failure rate” defined
    in {{IEV 192-05-07, IEV:192-05-07}}.
