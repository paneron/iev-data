  definition: time compression of an analogue luminance, chrominance or composite
    colour signal providing a reduction in the duration of the signal without modification
    of the line period
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The compressed signals may be located in any part of the line, and the space made
    available during this period may be utilized for other signals.
  - Temporal compression increases the bandwidth necessary for transmission of the
    analogue signal.
