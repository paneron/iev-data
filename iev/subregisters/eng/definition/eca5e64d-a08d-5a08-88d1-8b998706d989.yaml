  definition: 'quotient of the responsivity, stem:[s](stem:[Z]), when the detector
    is irradiated with radiation, stem:[Z], and the responsivity, stem:[s](stem:[N]),
    when it is irradiated with a reference radiation, stem:[N]


    stem:[s_r = ((s ( Z )))/((s ( N )))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The relative responsivity has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-05-55 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
