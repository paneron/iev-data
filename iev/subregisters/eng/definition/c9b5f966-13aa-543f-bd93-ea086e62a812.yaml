  definition: control by a device designed to operate in an identical manner on the
    positive and negative half cycles of an alternating voltage or current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'On the basis of identical positive or negative half cycles of the input source:


    – generalized phase control is symmetrical if the current waveform is the same
    for both positive and negative half cycles;


    – multicycle control is symmetrical if within each conduction period the number
    of positive and negative half cycles is equal.'
