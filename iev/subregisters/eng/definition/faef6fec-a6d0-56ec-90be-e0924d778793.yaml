  definition: the force of attraction between two magnetic poles of opposite polarity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the case of two parallel pole faces of equal area separated by a very small
    air gap, the magnetic pull is given by:


    stem:[F = (1)/((2 mu_0)) int B^2 d A]


    integrated over the area stem:[A] of one of the pole faces.'
