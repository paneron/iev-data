  definition: 'the magneto-ionic component which, at vertical incidence, is reflected
    at the height at which the electron density and the Earth''s magnetic field are
    such that:


    stem:[f]~p~^2^ = stem:[f] ^2^ + stem:[f f]~ B~


    where stem:[f]~p~ is the plasma frequency, stem:[f] is the wave frequency, and
    stem:[f]~ B~ is the electron gyro frequency'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This component may appear when the direction of propagation of the wave is close
    to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, or when the wave frequency is
    less than the electron gyro-frequency, and also in top-side ionospheric sounding.
  - The polarization of this component is either that of the ordinary wave, or that
    of the extraordinary wave, depending on the value of its frequency relative to
    the values of the plasma frequency and electron gyro-frequency on the wave path
    before reflection.
