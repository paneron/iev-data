data:
  definition: the ratio, usually expressed in decibels, for a radio link, of the power
    radiated by the transmitting antenna to the power that would be available at the
    receiving antenna output if there were no loss in the radio-frequency circuits
    of the antennas, it being assumed that the antenna radiation characteristics are
    retained
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Transmission loss is equal to system loss minus the loss in the radio-frequency
    circuits which are integral parts of the antennas.
