  examples: []
  notes:
  - The parting zone is not a part of the road tunnel, but it is closely related to
    the road tunnel lighting. The parting zone begins at the exit portal. It is advised
    that the length of the parting zone is equal to 2 times the stopping distance.
    A length of more than 200Â m is not necessary.
