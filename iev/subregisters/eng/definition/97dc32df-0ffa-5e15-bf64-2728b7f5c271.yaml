  definition: 'mathematical expression used for the evaluation of characteristics
    of magnetic materials and expressed in decibels by:


    stem:[T H D_F = 20 lg ( ((V_m // V_f))/((mu_((ea)) // C C F)) )]


    where


    stem:[V_m = sqrt(sum_((n = 1))^(oo) V_n^2)], where stem:[Vn] is the amplitude
    of the stem:[n]-th harmonic component of the waveform,


    stem:[V]~f~ is the amplitude of its fundamental component,


    stem:[μ]~ea~  is the amplitude permeability,


    stem:[CCF]  is the Circuit Correction Factor'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, stem:[C C F = 1 // sqrt(1 + ( 3 omega L_1 // R_s )^2)] stands for
    the Circuit Correction Factor and is given in the approximation for the third
    harmonic, which is valid for measurements without applied DC bias. stem:[L]~1~
    is the primary inductance. stem:[R]~s~ is the total source resistance (50 Ω).
  - stem:[THD]~F~ is sometimes expressed in decibels.
