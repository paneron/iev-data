  definition: the reference equivalent of the path followed by an echo and calculated
    by adding the sending reference equivalent, the receiving reference equivalent
    and the loss of the path followed by that echo between the sending system and
    the receiving system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The loss of an echo path is usually frequency-dependent, and its contribution
    to the echo reference equivalent is determined by frequency weighting, described
    in the section B.5 of the annex B of the CCITT Recommendation G.122 from the fascicule
    III.1 of the Red Book, 1985.
