data:
  definition: coordinate system commonly used in the photometry of luminaires in which
    the C-planes are half-planes that rotate round the vertical line through the photometric
    centre of the luminaire, and the γ-angles are measured up to 180° from the direction
    of the perpendicular to the rotation axis of the C-planes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Other coordinate systems &amp;lsqb;(A, α) coordinate system and (B, β) coordinate
    system&amp;rsqb; exist as well. See CIE 121, _The Photometry and Goniophotometry
    of Luminaires_.
