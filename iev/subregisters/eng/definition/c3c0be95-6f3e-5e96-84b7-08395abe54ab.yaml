  definition: free energy density difference between the normal state and the superconducting
    state
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At zero magnetic field strength and zero direct current, the superconducting condensation
    energy is given by stem:[( 1 // 2 ) mu_0 H_c^2], where stem:[mu_0] is the magnetic
    constant and stem:[H_c] is the critical field strength ({{815-10-21, IEV:815-10-21}}).
