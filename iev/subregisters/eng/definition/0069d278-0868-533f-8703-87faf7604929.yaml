  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the power of the wanted
    signal to that of the coexistent noise at a specified point in a transmission
    channel, usually at the receiver output, under specified conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The signal cannot generally be separated from noise, and in practice the ratio
    (signal+noise) to noise is measured.
  - 'The specified conditions comprise among others:


    – the nature and characteristics of the wanted signal,


    – the nature and characteristics of the noise,


    – the receiver and antenna characteristics such as the bandwidth.'
