data:
  definition: qualifies an input, output or transfer immittance when the other ports
    have zero terminating admittances, or a forward or reverse transfer ratio when
    the port corresponding to the numerator has zero terminating admittance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Examples in IEC 60027-2 are the open-circuit output impedance, the open-circuit
    output admittance, the open-circuit reverse voltage transfer ratio.
