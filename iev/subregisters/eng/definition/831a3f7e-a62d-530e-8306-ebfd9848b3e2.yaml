  definition: potential-driven effect experienced by external manifolded {{molten
    carbonate fuel cell, IEV:485-08-06}} stacks
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The {{electrolyte, IEV:485-03-01}} tends to migrate from the positive end of the
    stack to the negative end. The migration occurs through the gaskets placed between
    the external {{manifolds, IEV:485-06-15}} and the stack's edges.
