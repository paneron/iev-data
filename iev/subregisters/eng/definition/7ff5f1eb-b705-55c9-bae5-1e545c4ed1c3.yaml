      modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: 'mean per {{character, IEV:702-05-10}} of the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}}
    for all possible messages from a {{stationary message source, IEV:171-07-09}}


    stem:[H^( '' ) = underset((m -&gt; oo))((lim)) ((H_m))/(m)]


    where stem:[Hm] is the entropy of the set of all sequences of stem:[m] characters
    from the source'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The character mean entropy can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon per
    character.
  - The limit might not exist if the source were not stationary.
