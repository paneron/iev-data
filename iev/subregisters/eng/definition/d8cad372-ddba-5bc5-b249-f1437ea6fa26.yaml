  definition: effective dose with the spectral radiant exposure spectrally weighted
    with a stated photobiological action spectrum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the photobiological effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - The photobiological dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^).
