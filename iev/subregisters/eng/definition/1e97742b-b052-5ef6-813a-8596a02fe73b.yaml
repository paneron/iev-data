  definition: an electromagnetic wave which adds to the reflected wave of geometrical
    optics when the angle of incidence to a surface approximately equals the critical
    value for total reflection, producing a beam which is widened relative to the
    direction of propagation, and shifted parallel to the surface and to the plane
    of incidence
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The lateral wave may be considered as the set of emergent waves produced in the
    first medium by an electromagnetic wave which propagates in the second medium
    close to the surface. For angles of incidence greater than the critical value,
    the field in the second medium is no longer propagated, and is an evanescent field.
