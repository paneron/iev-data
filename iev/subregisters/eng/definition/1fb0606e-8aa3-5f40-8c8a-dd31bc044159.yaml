data:
  definition: smallest contrast, produced at the eye of an observer by a given object,
    which renders the object perceptible against a given background
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For meteorological observations, the object has to be rendered recognizable, and
    hence a higher threshold is to be expected. The value of 0,05 has been adopted
    as the basis for the measurement of <a href="IEV845-31-018">meteorological optical
    range</a>.
