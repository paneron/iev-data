  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists only
    in an unsymmetrical three-phase system of sinusoidal quantities and which is defined
    by the following complex mathematical expression:


    stem:[X]~0~ = 1/3 (stem:[X]~L1~ + stem:[X]~L2~ + stem:[X]~L3~)


    where stem:[X]~L1~, stem:[X]~L2~ and stem:[X]~L3~ are the complex expressions
    of the phase quantities concerned, and where stem:[X] denotes the system current
    or voltage phasors'
