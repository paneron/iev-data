  definition: additive vector quantity characterizing external interactions on a particle
    or body
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '1 Forces cause the particle or body to change its momentum *stem:[p]* = stem:[mv]
    according to the second Newton law: d*stem:[p]*/dstem:[t] = *stem:[F]* (in inertial
    frame), where *stem:[F]* is the resultant of all acting forces. The equation applies
    also in the theory of relativity.'
  - 2 Force may lead to the deformation of the body.
  - 3 In any inertial frame, a resultant force *stem:[F]* acting on a body with constant
    mass stem:[m] causes an acceleration *stem:[a]* = *stem:[F]*/stem:[m] of the centre
    of mass of the body.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of force is newton, N.
