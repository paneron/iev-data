  definition: 'for a magnetic core operating within the Rayleigh region, and having
    given geometry and material properties, the magnetic path length, the cross-sectional
    area and the volume that a hypothetical toroidal core of the same material properties
    and of radially thin uniform cross-section should possess to be magnetically equivalent
    to the given core


    Note 1 – The effective dimensions are as follows:


    effective cross-sectional area


    stem:[A_e = ((C_1))/((C_2))]


    effective magnetic path length,


    stem:[l_e = ((C_1^2))/((C_2))]


    effective volume,


    stem:[V_e = ((C_1^3))/((C_2^2))]


    where stem:[C]~1~ and stem:[C]~2~ are the appropriate core factors hence:


    stem:[C_1 = ((l_e))/((A_e))]


    stem:[C_2 = ((l_e))/((A_e^2))]


    stem:[V_e = l_e A_e]


    Note 2 – These formulae can also apply to a magnetic circuit operating outside
    the limit of the Rayleigh region provided the magnetization can be assumed to
    be uniform, for example as in an Epstein square.'
