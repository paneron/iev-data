  definition: 'quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a>,
    stem:[Xλ](stem:[λ]), of a radiant, luminous or photon quantity, stem:[X](stem:[λ]),
    and a fixed reference value, stem:[R], which can be an average value, a maximum
    value or an arbitrarily chosen value of this distribution


    stem:[S ( lambda ) = ((X_(lambda) ( lambda )))/(R)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The relative spectral distribution has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-18 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
