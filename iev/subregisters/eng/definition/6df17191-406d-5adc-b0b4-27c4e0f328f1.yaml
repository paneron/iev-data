  definition: 'vector quantity obtained at a given point by subtracting the magnetization
    stem:[*M*] from the magnetic flux density stem:[*B*] divided by the magnetic constant
    stem:[μ]~0~:


    stem:[H = (B)/((mu_0)) - M]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the magnetic field strength is at all points equal to the magnetic
    flux density divided by the magnetic constant:


    stem:[H = (B)/((mu_0))]'
  - 'The rotation of the magnetic field strength is the total current density *stem:[J]*~t~:


    *rot stem:[H]* = *stem:[J]*~t~'
  - The magnetic flux density stem:[*B*] is sometimes called “magnetic field”, risking
    confusion with the magnetic field strength stem:[*H*].
