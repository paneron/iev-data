      modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
        adaptation to the IEV rules

  notes:
  - The bit can be combined with SI prefixes, e.g. kilobit (kbit), or with binary
    prefixes, e.g. kibibit (Kibit). For binary multiples (powers of 2), the use of
    binary prefixes is recommended to avoid ambiguity.
  - The unit bit can be combined with other units, e.g. bit per second (bit/s).
