  definition: 'the integral of the square of the current over a given time interval:


    stem:[I^2 t = int_((t_0))^((t_1)) i^2 d t]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The pre-arcing stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] is the stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] integral extended
    over the pre-arcing time of the fuse.
  - The operating stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] is the stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] integral extended
    over the operating time of the fuse.
  - The energy in joules liberated in one ohm of resistance in a circuit protected
    by a fuse is equal to the value of the operating stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] expressed
    in stem:[A]^2^ â€¢ stem:[s].
