    original: IEC 61340-3-1:2006, modified â€“ "ESD voltage level" replaced by "electrostatic
      discharge (ESD) voltage" and "UUTs" replaced by "devices or units under test
      (UUT)".

    relationship:
      modification: '"ESD voltage level" replaced by "electrostatic discharge (ESD)
        voltage" and "UUTs" replaced by "devices or units under test (UUT)".'
      type: modified
  definition: maximum applied {{electrostatic discharge, IEV:161-01-22}} (ESD) voltage
    that does not cause failure parameter limits to be exceeded, provided that all
    devices or units under test (UUT) stressed at lower levels have also passed
