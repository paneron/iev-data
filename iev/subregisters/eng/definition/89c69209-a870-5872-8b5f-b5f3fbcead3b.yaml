  definition: phenomenon in which, in the absence of an applied magnetic field, the
    magnetic area moments of neighbouring atoms or ions in a substance are held by
    their interactions in a partially cancelling arrangement such that there remains
    a resultant magnetic area moment and in which, when a magnetic field is applied,
    the alignment of the magnetic area moments in its direction increases up to a
    certain limit
