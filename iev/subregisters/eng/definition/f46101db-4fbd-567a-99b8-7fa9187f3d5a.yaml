  definition: production process of a film by involving chemical reactions of gases
    (vapours) which include the desired constituent atoms
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Organometallic or other compounds are transported at relatively low temperature
    to the reaction area using a carrier gas where the products of the reaction are
    deposited on a substrate (e.g. MOCVD, halide CVD, plasma enhanced CVD, laser enhanced
    CVD).
