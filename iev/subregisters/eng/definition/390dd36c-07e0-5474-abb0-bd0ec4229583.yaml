  definition: for a linear two-terminal-pair network or stem:[n]-terminal-pair network,
    quotient of the phasor representing the voltage at an input port by the phasor
    representing the electric current at an output port, when all other ports are
    connected to specified terminating immittances
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The input is usually connected to an ideal voltage source.
