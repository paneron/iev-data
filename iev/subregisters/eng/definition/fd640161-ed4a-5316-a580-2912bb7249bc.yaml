  definition: 'graphical representation of the frequency response by polar coordinates
    as a curve in the complex plane with the angular frequency as the curve parameter


    SEE: Figure 9.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At the frequency response locus the modulus (absolute value) of the polar coordinates
    is the gain and its argument is the phase angle at a given angular frequency.
