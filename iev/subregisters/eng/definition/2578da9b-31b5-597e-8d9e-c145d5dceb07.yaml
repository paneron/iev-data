  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists only
    in an unsymmetrical three-phase system of sinusoidal quantities and which is defined
    by the following complex mathematical expression:


    stem:[X]~2~ = 1/3(stem:[X]~L1~ + stem:[a]^2^stem:[X]~L2~ + stem:[a] stem:[X]~L3~)


    where stem:[a] is the 120 degree operator, and stem:[X]~L1~, stem:[X]~L2~ and
    stem:[X]~L3~ are the complex expressions of the phase quantities concerned, and
    where stem:[X] denotes the system current or voltage phasors'
