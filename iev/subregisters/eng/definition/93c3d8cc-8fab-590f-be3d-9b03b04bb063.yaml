  definition: vector *grad* stem:[f] associated at each point of a given space region
    with a scalar stem:[f], having a direction normal to the surface on which the
    scalar field has a constant value, in the sense of increasing value of stem:[f],
    and a magnitude equal to the absolute value of the derivative of stem:[f] with
    respect to distance in this normal direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The gradient expresses the variation of the scalar field quantity from the given
    point to a point at an infinitesimal distance stem:[d s] in the direction of a
    given unit vector *stem:[e]* by the scalar product dstem:[f] = *grad* stem:[f]
    ⋅ *stem:[e]* dstem:[s].
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the three coordinates of the gradient are:


    stem:[((del f))/((del x)) , ((del f))/((del y)) , ((del f))/((del z))].'
  - The gradient of the scalar field stem:[f] is denoted *grad* stem:[f] or stem:[grad
    f].
