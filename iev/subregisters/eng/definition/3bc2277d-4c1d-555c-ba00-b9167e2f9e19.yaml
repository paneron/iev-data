        interface" has been deleted since no interface is referred to earlier in the
        definition. In Note 2 to entry, the sentence has been redrafted for clarity:
        "an electric transduction" has been deleted and "produced" has been replaced
        by "transduced to an electric signal".'

  definition: '{{, IEV:nanoscale device}} or embedded system involving one or more
    electronic and non-electronic components enabling the integration of electric
    and mechanical functionality of the system'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The components can be organic, inorganic or hybrid nanotechnology-based and function
    on the {{nanoscale, IEV:511-01-03}} for sensing, actuation, signal processing,
    display, or {{control, IEV:351-42-19}}.
  - The components can be micro- or nano-machined to produce free surfaces and volumes
    that will be able to couple with the environment so that a physical, optical,
    chemical, or biological phenomenon is transduced to an electric signal.
