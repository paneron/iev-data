  definition: luminance coefficient multiplied by the cube of the cosine of the angle
    of incidence of the light on a point on a surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The reduced luminance coefficient can be expressed by the equation


    stem:[r] = stem:[q](cos stem:[ε])^3^


    ^


    where^ stem:[q] is the luminance coefficient in steradian to the power minus one
    (sr^−1^), and stem:[ε] is the angle of incidence in degree (°).'
  - The angle of observation, stem:[α], affects the value of stem:[r]. By convention
    this angle is fixed at 1° for road lighting calculations.
  - The reduced luminance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus
    one (sr^−1^).
