  definition: passive stem:[m]-terminal-pair circuit element characterized by functional
    relations between the instantaneous electric currents at each pair of terminals
    and the linked fluxes between the terminals of each pair
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric energy absorbed by an inductive stem:[m]-terminal-pair element is
    stored in magnetic form and is completely recoverable.
