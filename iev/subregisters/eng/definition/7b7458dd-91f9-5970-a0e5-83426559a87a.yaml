  definition: ratio of the r.m.s. value of the harmonic content to the r.m.s. value
    of the fundamental component or the reference fundamental component of an alternating
    quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The total harmonic ratio depends on the choice of the fundamental component. If
    it is not clear from the context which one is used an indication should be given.
  - The total harmonic ratio may be restricted to a certain harmonic order. This is
    to be stated.
