  concept: 0009aed0-4582-5ae7-b126-9c2beeaf21f9
  definition: macroscopic quantum effect in which a direct current of Cooper pairs
    flows by tunnelling through a Josephson junction without power dissipation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The maximum value of the dissipationless direct current is strongly dependent
    on the applied magnetic flux density.
