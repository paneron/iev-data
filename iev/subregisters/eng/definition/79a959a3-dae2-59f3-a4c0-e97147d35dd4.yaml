  definition: "for a network containing stem:[l] directed loops and stem:[b] branches,\
    \ and in which a reference direction is chosen for each branch, matrix of type\
    \ stem:[l] × stem:[b] where the element stem:[a]~stem:[ij]~ is:\r\n<ul style=\"\
    list-style: none;\">\r\n* 0 if branch stem:[j] is not in loop stem:[i]\r\n* 1\
    \ if branch stem:[j] is in loop stem:[i] with the same direction\r\n* −1 if branch\
    \ stem:[j] is in loop stem:[i] with opposite direction"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - – The figure gives a network and the corresponding branch-mesh incidence matrix
    when both loops 1 and 2 are directed anticlockwise.
