  definition: 'at a point fixed in a medium with a temperature field, scalar quantity
    stem:[λ] characterizing the ability of the medium to transmit heat through a surface
    element containing that point: *stem:[φ]* = −stem:[λ] *grad* stem:[T], where *stem:[φ]*
    is the density of heat flow rate and stem:[T] is thermodynamic temperature'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 In an anisotropic medium, thermal conductivity is a tensor quantity.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of thermal conductivity is watt per metre kelvin, W/(m·K).
