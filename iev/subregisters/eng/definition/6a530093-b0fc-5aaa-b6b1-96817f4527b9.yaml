      type: identical
  definition: micromachining in which an intermediate layer sandwiched between two
    layers of a different material is preferentially (sacrificially) etched and selectively
    removed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Usually, the etch selectivity is high between the intermediate layer and the two
    sandwich layers. The purpose of the sacrificial layer is to mechanically release
    one or both of the sandwich layers. Silicon oxide is a commonly used sacrificial
    layer.
