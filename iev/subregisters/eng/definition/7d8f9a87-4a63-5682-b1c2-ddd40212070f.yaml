  definition: 'a measure of the relative difference in refractive index of the core
    and the cladding of an optical fibre, given by:


    stem:[Delta = ((n_1^2 - n_2^2))/((2 n_1^2))]


    where stem:[n]~1~ and stem:[n]~2~ are, respectively, the maximum in the core and
    the refractive index of the innermost homogeneous cladding'
