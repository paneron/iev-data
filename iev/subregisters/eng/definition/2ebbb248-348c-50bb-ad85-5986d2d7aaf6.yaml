  definition: deformation of a body due to electric polarization arising from an applied
    electric field and identical on reversal of the electric field strength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an isotropic substance, electrostriction increases the volumic mass of the
    body proportionally to the square of the magnitude of the electric field strength.
