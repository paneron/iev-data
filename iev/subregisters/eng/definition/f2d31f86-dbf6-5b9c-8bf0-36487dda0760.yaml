data:
  definition: conditioning of a specimen with the object of removing or partly counter-acting
    the effect of its previous history with respect, principally, to the temperature
    and humidity to which it has been exposed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Preconditioning is sometimes known as normalizing.
  - Preconditioning usually precedes conditioning of a specimen. When the combination
    of temperature and humidity for conditioning is the same as that prescribed for
    preconditioning, the preconditioning may be said to take the place of conditioning.
