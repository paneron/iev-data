  definition: quantity for which all the exponents of the factors corresponding to
    the base quantities in its dimension are zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "dimensionless quantity" is commonly used and is kept for historical
    reasons. It stems from the fact that all exponents are zero in the symbolic representation
    of the dimension for such quantities. The term "quantity of dimension one" reflects
    the convention in which the symbolic representation of the dimension for such
    quantities is the symbol `1`, printed in sans-serif type. This dimension is not
    the number one, but the neutral element for the multiplication of dimensions.
  - The measurement units and values of quantities of dimension one are numbers, but
    such quantities convey more information than a number.
  - 'Some quantities of dimension one are defined as the ratios of two quantities
    of the same kind. Examples: plane angle, solid angle, refractive index, relative
    permeability, mass fraction, friction factor, Mach number. Unless a special name
    exists, the name of such a quantity often includes one of the terms factor or
    ratio, or sometimes number, fraction, or index, or the adjective relative (see
    section 112-03). The coherent derived unit is one. The dimension of such quantities
    may be denoted by the dimension of the dividend raised to power zero. Examples:


    dim(plane angle) = L^0^,


    dim(refractive index stem:[n] = stem:[c]~0~/stem:[c]) = (LT^–1^)^0^,


    dim(mass fraction) = M^0^,


    dim(friction factor stem:[μ] = stem:[F]~r~ /stem:[F]~n~) = dim(force)^0^ = (MLT^–2^)^0^.'
  - Quantities of dimension one can also be numbers of entities (IEV 112-01-09).
