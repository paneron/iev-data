  notes:
  - This term is used in the "true value" approach.
  - This is a value that would be obtained by a perfect measurement.
  - True values are by nature indeterminate.
  - The indefinite article "a", rather than the definite article "the", is used in
    conjunction with "true value" because there can be many values consistent with
    the definition of a given particular quantity.
