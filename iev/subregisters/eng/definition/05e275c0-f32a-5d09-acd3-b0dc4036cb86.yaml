data:
  definition: ratio of the stress response rate of the test specimen under the accelerated
    conditions, to the stress response rate under specified operational conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Both stress response rates refer to the same time interval in the life of the
    tested items.
  - Measures of stress response rate are, for example, operating time to failure,
    failure intensity, and rate of wear.
