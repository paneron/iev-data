  definition: illuminance averaged over a circular aperture of 100 mmÂ² area normal
    to the LED's mechanical axis at a distance of 100 mm for CIE Standard Condition
    A or 316 mm for CIE Standard Condition B from the tip of the LED, multiplied by
    the square of the distance and divided by a unit solid angle
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A detailed method of measurement is given in CIE 127, _Measurement of LEDs_.
  - The geometric conditions CIE Standard Condition A and CIE Standard Condition B,
    which correspond to symbols stem:[I]~LED,A~ and stem:[I]~LED,B~ respectively,
    are defined in CIE 127, _Measurement of LEDs_.
  - The averaged LED intensity is expressed in candela (cd).
