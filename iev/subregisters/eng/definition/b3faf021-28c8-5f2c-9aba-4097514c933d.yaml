  definition: wind velocity experienced at a fixed point of the rotating wind turbine
    rotor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The turbulence spectrum of a rotationally sampled wind velocity is distinctly
    different from the normal turbulence spectrum. While rotating, the blade cuts
    through a wind flow, that varies in space. Therefore the resulting turbulence
    spectrum will contain sizeable amounts of variance at the frequency of rotation
    and harmonics of the same.
