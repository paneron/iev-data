data:
  definition: a technique for measuring certain optical fibre transmission characteristics,
    such as attenuation and bandwidth, by performing two transmission measurements
    ; one measurement is made at the output of the full length of the fibre and the
    other is made at the output of a short length of the same fibre, access being
    gained by "cutting back" the fibre being measured, without changing the launching
    conditions
