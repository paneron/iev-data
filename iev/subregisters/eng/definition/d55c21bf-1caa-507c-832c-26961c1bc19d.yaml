data:
  definition: a wound-rotor induction machine in which the frequency conversion is
    obtained by induction between a primary winding and a secondary winding rotating
    with respect to each other, the secondary winding delivering power at a frequency
    proportional to the relative speed of the primary magnetic field and the member
    carrying the secondary winding
