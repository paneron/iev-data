  definition: unit for evaluating the subjective degradation of a picture under specified
    conditions of observation, derived from a reference image which has a medium rating
    using a given quality scale or impairment scale
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under certain conditions the imp units are summable, in the sense that the subjective
    degradation due to several non-correlated faults is the sum of the degradations
    due to each fault considered separately.
  - The method of use of imp units is described in CCIR Report 405.
