data:
  definition: voltage at which partial discharges are extinguished in the test arrangement
    when the voltage applied to the test object is gradually decreased from a higher
    value at which such discharges are observed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - With sinusoidal applied voltage, the partial discharge extinction voltage is defined
    as the r.m.s. value of the voltage. With impulse voltages, the partial discharge
    extinction voltage is defined as the peak-to-peak voltage.
