data:
  definition: electromagnetic radiation in which the electric field vector rotates
    at the radiation frequency, but varies in magnitude at a rate equal to twice the
    radiation frequency with the terminal point of the electric field vector describing
    an ellipse
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Elliptically polarized radiation is described as right-handed (or left-handed)
    if the rotation of the electric field vector is clockwise (or anticlockwise) as
    viewed by an observer receiving the radiation.
