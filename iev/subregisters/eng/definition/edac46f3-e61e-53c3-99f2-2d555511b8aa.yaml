data:
  definition: set of all microstates fitting a given property, thus resulting in a
    description at a level less detailed than that given for a microstate
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If stem:[n] is the number of microstates in a macrostate, entropy ({{113-04-22,
    IEV:113-04-22}}) is proportional to the logarithm of stem:[n].
