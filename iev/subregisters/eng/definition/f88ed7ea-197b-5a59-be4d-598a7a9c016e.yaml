  definition: radio link from an Earth station at a given location to a space station,
    or vice-versa, conveying information for a space radiocommunication service other
    than the fixed-satellite service
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The fixed-satellite service is the radiocommunication service between Earth stations
    at given positions. “Feeder link” is a regulatory term, used for radio links to
    which frequencies in a frequency band allocated to the fixed-satellite service
    may be assigned, although such links do not form a part of that service.
  - The given location may be at a specified fixed point, or at any fixed point within
    specified areas.
  - 'Examples of feeder links:


    – an up-link for a broadcasting satellite;


    – the part of a forward link to a space station or a return link from a space
    station which is between the Earth station and a data relay satellite;


    – an up-link and down-link between a coast Earth station and a satellite in the
    maritime mobile-satellite service.'
