data:
  definition: hollow sphere, the interior of which is formed from, or coated with,
    a diffusely-reflecting material that is as spectrally neutral and as spatially
    uniform as possible
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Owing to the internal reflections within the sphere, the illuminance on any part
    of the inside surface of the sphere for which the direct flux is hidden is theoretically
    proportional to the luminous flux entering the sphere or produced inside the sphere.
    The illuminance of the internal sphere wall can be measured via a small window.
  - The window of an integrating sphere is often used in radiometric measurement systems
    to provide a source with good spatial uniformity and with an angular distribution
    of radiance or luminance that is close to Lambert's cosine law.
