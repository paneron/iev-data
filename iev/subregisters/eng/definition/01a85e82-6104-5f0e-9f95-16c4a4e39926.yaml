  examples: []
  notes:
  - Examples of actuating drives are electric, hydraulic or pneumatic actuating drives,
    diaphragm systems or piston actuators.
  - No actuating drive is required for a final controlling element if the manipulated
    variable at the controller output is capable of directly influencing the mass
    flow or energy flow, i.e. without any mechanical intermediate variable quantity.
