    in one direction between two points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Several transmission channels can share a common path: for example, where each
    transmission channel is allocated a particular {{frequency band, IEV:103-09-01}}
    or a particular {{time-slot, IEV:704-13-08}}.'
  - The adjective "transmission" can be replaced by an adjective indicating the nature
    of the transmitted signals, or the {{frequency bandwidth, IEV:702-01-03}}, or
    the {{digit rate, IEV:702-05-23}}; for example, telephone channel, {{telegraph
    channel, IEV:721-11-01}}, {{data channel, IEV:714-12-01}}, 10 MHz channel, 34
    Mbit/s channel.
