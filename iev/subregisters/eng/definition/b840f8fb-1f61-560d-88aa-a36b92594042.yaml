  definition: vector quantity *stem:[a]* = d*stem:[v]*/dstem:[t], where *stem:[v]*
    is velocity and stem:[t] is time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The acceleration is related to a point described by its position vector. The
    point may localize a particle, or be attached to any other object such as a body
    or a wave.
  - 2 The acceleration depends on the chosen reference frame.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of acceleration is metre per second squared, m/s^2^.
