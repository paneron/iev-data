  definition: 'time interval required for the trailing edge of a waveform to change
    between two defined levels which may be either the logic levels stem:[V]~OH~ and
    stem:[V]~OL~ [being at 90 % and 10 %, respectively, of the maximum amplitude (equalling
    stem:[V]~HI~ – stem:[V]~LO~)], or any other ratio as defined in the detail specification


    where


    stem:[V]~OL~ is the low level output voltage


    stem:[V]~OH~ is the high level output voltage


    stem:[V]~HI~ is the upper flat voltage of the pulse waveform


    stem:[V]~LO~ is the low flat voltage of the pulse waveform
