      type: modified
  definition: process for creating a microstructure that can be used as a mould by
    using deep lithography, based on X-rays followed by electroforming
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'LIGA is an acronym for Lithographie, Galvanoformung und Abformung, the German
    for lithography, {{electroforming, IEV:523-05-17}}, and moulding. Characteristics
    of the LIGA process include the ability to mass-produce high {{aspect-ratio, IEV:523-07-04}}
    microstructures with a line width of 1 µm to 10 µm and a height of several hundreds
    of micrometres, to allow the use of a wide range of materials including plastics,
    metals, and ceramics, and to be combined with silicon {{semiconductor, IEV:521-02-01}}
