data:
  definition: the current flowing through a line terminal of a winding when a given
    voltage is applied at rated frequency, the other winding(s) being open-circuited
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Normally the applied voltage is the rated voltage and the energized winding, if
    fitted with tappings, is connected on its principal tapping.
  - The no-load current of a winding is often expressed as a percentage of the rated
    current of the same winding.
