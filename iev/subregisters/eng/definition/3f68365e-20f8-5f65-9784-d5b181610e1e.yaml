    relationship:
      type: identical
  definition: wetting of a {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}} controlled by the voltage
    between a droplet and the substrate covered with a dielectric film
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The contact angle of a liquid droplet, typically an {{electrolyte, IEV:114-01-02}},
    on a substrate can be electrically controlled because the solid-liquid surface
    {{interfacial tension, IEV:212-18-10}} can be controlled with the energy stored
    in the electric {{double layer, IEV:114-02-19}} which works as a {{capacitor,
    IEV:151-13-28}}. Covering the {{electrode, IEV:151-13-01}} with a {{dielectric
    material, IEV:561-01-16}} of determined thickness, the {{capacitance, IEV:131-12-13}}
    can be determined with ease. Electro-wetting on dielectric is used typically in
    microfluidic {{devices, IEV:151-11-20}}.
