  definition: depth below the surface of a load, above which (1-1/e) of the totally
    absorbed power flux density of a given frequency has been absorbed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The power absorption depth for a large plane load with perpendicular incidence
    equals the power penetration depth and is applicable for modes and curved surfaces.
