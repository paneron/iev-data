data:
  definition: the direction of the time-average Poynting vector at a fixed point in
    a transmission line
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a uniform transmission line, the direction of propagation of energy is often
    taken along the longitudinal axis.
  - In a uniform lossless waveguide, the direction of propagation of energy at every
    point of a transverse cross-section is parallel to the longitudinal axis.
