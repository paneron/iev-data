  definition: a contact piston in which rubbing contact is made at the free ends of
    thin quarter-wave length long metal strips which extend from the plunger face
    and lie close to the waveguide walls
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The actual contact is thus made in a region of low current and high voltage, so
    that the effects of contact resistance are minimized.
