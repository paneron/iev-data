  definition: equipment intended to initiate the scheduled, sequential and delayed

  notes:
  - Automatic restoration could follow an unsuccessful automatic reclosure or a generalized
    disconnection condition with, or without, automatic reclosing operation. Automatic
    restoration is normally programmed to restore voltage partially, or to whole stations,
    after a widespread disturbance has occurred.
