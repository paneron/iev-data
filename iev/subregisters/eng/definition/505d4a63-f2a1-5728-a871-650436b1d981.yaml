  definition: for a plane surface, scalar quantity equal to the second axial moment
    of area stem:[I]~a~ with respect to a specified axis Q in the plane of the surface,
    divided by the maximum radial distance stem:[r]~Q, max~ of any point in the surface
    considered from the Q-axis, thus stem:[Z = ((I_a))/((r_((Q, max))))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coherent SI unit of section modulus is metre cubed, m^3^.
