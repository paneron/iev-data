  definition: any real or complex number for which the product by itself is equal
    to a given real or complex number
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Every non-zero real or complex number has two square roots, each being the negative
    of the other. For a non-negative real number stem:[a], the non-negative square
    root is denoted by stem:[a^(1 // 2)] or stem:[sqrt(a)]. For a negative real number
    stem:[a], the number stem:[- a] is positive and the two square roots are imaginary
    numbers, conjugate of each others, denoted by stem:[j sqrt(- a)] and stem:[- j
    sqrt(- a)]. For a complex number stem:[c = | c | e^(j phi)], the two square roots
    are stem:[sqrt(| c |) e^(j phi // 2)] and stem:[sqrt(| c |) e^(j ( (phi)/(2) +
    pi ))].
  - The concept of square root may be applied to scalar quantities.
