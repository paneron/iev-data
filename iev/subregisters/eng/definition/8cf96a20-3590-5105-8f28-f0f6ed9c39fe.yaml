  definition: spectral internal transmittance of a layer of an absorbing material
    such that the path of the radiation is of dimension length, and under conditions
    in which the boundary of the material has no influence
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The unit of length has to be specified. If a new unit of length is used that is
    stem:[k] times the magnitude of the original one, then the value of stem:[τ]~i,o~(stem:[λ])
    will change to stem:[tau^( ' )_(i ,o)^() ( lambda ) = tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )^k].
  - The spectral transmissivity has unit one.
