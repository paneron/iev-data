  definition: magnetic circuit element characterized by a functional relation between
    magnetic tension and magnetic flux
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The magnetic tension is defined in IEC 60050-121, item No 121-11-57, as the line
    integral of the magnetic field strength along a specified path linking two points.
    When the magnetic field strength is irrotational, the magnetic tension is the
    negative of the magnetic potential difference.
