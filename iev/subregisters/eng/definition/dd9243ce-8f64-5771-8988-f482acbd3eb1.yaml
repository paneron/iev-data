  definition: that polarization of a plane wave of given power flux density incident
    from a specified direction, which results in maximum received power at the antenna
    terminals, for that direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction is assumed to be that of the highest
    maximum received power, over all the directions in space.
  - The receiving polarization of an antenna can be determined from the polarization
    of the antenna employed as transmitting antenna, since, in the same plane of polarization,
    the polarization ellipses have the same axial ratio, the same sense of polarization
    and the same spatial orientation.
