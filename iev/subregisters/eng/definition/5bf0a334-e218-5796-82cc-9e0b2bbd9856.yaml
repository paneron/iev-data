data:
  definition: wind speed of 8 m/s at reference conditions (10 m height, roughness
    length equal to 0,05 m) used in the calculation of the apparent sound power level
    to provide a uniform basis for the comparison of apparent sound power levels from
    different wind turbine generator system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The acoustic reference speed is generally expressed in meters per second.
