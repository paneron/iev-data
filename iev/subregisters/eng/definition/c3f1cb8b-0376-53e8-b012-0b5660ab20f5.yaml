data:
  definition: product of the effective output power of the transmitter multiplied
    by the antenna gain
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The gain is produced by an antenna concentrating radiation in a particular direction
    and is always related to a specified reference antenna
  - The threshold power is considered to be equal to the effective isotropic radiated
    power (EIRP), as per ITU-R BS.561-2, _Definitions of radiation in LF, MF and HF
    broadcasting bands_.
