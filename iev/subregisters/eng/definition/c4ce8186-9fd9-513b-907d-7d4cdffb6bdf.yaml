  definition: 'product of the rms voltage stem:[U] between the terminals of a two-terminal
    element or two-terminal circuit and the rms electric current stem:[I] in the element
    or circuit


    stem:[S] = stem:[UI]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under sinusoidal conditions, the apparent power is the modulus of the complex
    power stem:[underset(_)(S)], thus stem:[S = | underset(_)(S) |].
  - The coherent SI unit for apparent power is voltampere, VA.
