  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of
    length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light
    in vacuum stem:[c] to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit m s^−1^, where
    the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency Δstem:[ν]~Cs~."'
  - 'The metre is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: {{second, IEV:112-02-04}}
    (s), metre (m), {{kilogram, IEV:112-02-06}} (kg), {{ampere, IEV:112-02-07}} (A),
    {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), {{mole, IEV:112-02-09}} (mol) and {{candela, IEV:112-02-10}}
