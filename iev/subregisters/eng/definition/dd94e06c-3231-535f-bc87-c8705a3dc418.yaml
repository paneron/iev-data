  definition: a curve showing the energy flux density or, more often, the exposure
    rate of a beam of photon radiation, either mono-energetic radiation or heterogeneous
    radiation, under narrow-beam conditions as a function of thickness of material
    such as aluminium, copper or lead, usually with specified and constant X-ray tube
    voltages and with as little initial filtration as possible
