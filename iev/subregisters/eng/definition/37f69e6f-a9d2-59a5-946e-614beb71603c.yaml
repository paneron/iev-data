data:
  definition: product of geometric extent and the squared refractive index of a medium
    through which the beam propagates
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The optical extent is invariant and remains constant when the beam is propagating
    through successive non-diffusing media.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-21-047">geometric extent</a>".
  - The optical extent is expressed in square metre times steradian (m^2^Â·sr).
