  definition: the ratio, along a transmission line, of a maximum to an adjacent minimum
    magnitude of a particular field component of a standing wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'This ratio is equal to: (1 + stem:[r]) / (1 â€” stem:[r]) where stem:[r] is the
    modulus of the amplitude reflection factor.'
  - The standing-wave ratio expressed as the reciprocal of the ratio defined above
    is occasionally used, but this usage is deprecated.
