    relationship:
      type: identical
  definition: maximum value of single-phase overcurrent which, in the absence of a
    residual current, can flow through a residual current device (whatever the number
    of poles) without causing it to operate
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of overcurrent in the main circuit, in the absence of residual current,
    operation of the detecting device can occur as a consequence of asymmetry existing
    in the detecting device itself.
