      modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: 'mean value of the {{information content, IEV:171-07-14}} of the events
    in a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events


    stem:[H = sum_((i = 1))^n p ( x_i ) * I ( x_i ) = sum_((i = 1))^n p ( x_i ) *
    log ( (1)/((p ( x_i ))) )]


    where stem:[X = { x_1 , ... , x_n }] is the set of events stem:[x_i ( i = 1, ...
    , n )], stem:[I ( x_i )] are their information contents and stem:[p ( x_i )] the
    probabilities of their occurrences, subject to stem:[sum_((i = 1))^n p ( x_i )
    = 1]'
  examples:
  - Let stem:[{ a , b , c }] be a set of three events and let stem:[p ( a ) = 0,5],
    stem:[p ( b ) = 0,25] and stem:[p ( c ) = 0,25] be the probabilities of their
    occurrences. The entropy of this set is stem:[H ( X ) = p ( a ) * I ( a ) + p
    ( b ) * I ( b ) + p ( c ) * I ( c ) = 1,5 Sh].
