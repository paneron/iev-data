  definition: temperature scale adopted by the International Committee on Weights
    and Measures (CIPM) in 1989 for the purpose of practical measurements
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The quantities corresponding to thermodynamic temperature and Celsius temperature
    defined by this scale are denoted stem:[T]~90~ and stem:[t]~90~, respectively,
    where stem:[t]~90~ = stem:[T]~90~ − stem:[T]~0~ with stem:[T]~0~:= 273,15 K.
  - 2 The units of stem:[T]~90~ and stem:[t]~90~ are the kelvin, symbol K, and the
    degree Celsius, symbol °C, respectively.
