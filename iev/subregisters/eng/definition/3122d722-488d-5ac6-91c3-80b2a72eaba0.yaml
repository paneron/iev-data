data:
  definition: a wave which occurs in a medium when an incident wave propagating in
    this medium encounters one or more obstacles possibly with limiting openings,
    and which is not interpretable by geometrical optics
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A diffracted wave may exist in regions which are not reached by the incident wave
    or by reflected or refracted waves.
  - Certain waves propagating in the vicinity of a surface, such as surface wave,
    leaky wave, lateral wave, are not generally considered as diffracted waves, in
    spite of the fact that they are not interpretable by geometrical optics.
  - The diffracted wave can be studied by using approximate methods, having similarities
    with geometrical optics, such as the geometrical theory of diffraction.
