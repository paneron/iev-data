data:
  definition: sum of all {{equivalent peak interruption durations, IEV:692-11-03}}
    in a {{bulk electric system, IEV:692-01-04}} during one year
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the {{energy not supplied, IEV:692-09-06}} is expressed in megawatt-minutes,
    and the annual peak load expressed in megawatts, then the bulk power energy curtailment
    index provides the system minutes aggregated over one year, and is expressed in
    minutes per year.
