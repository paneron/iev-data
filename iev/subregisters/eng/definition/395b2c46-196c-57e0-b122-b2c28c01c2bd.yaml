  definition: for an eigenvalue stem:[λ] of a square matrix *stem:[A]*, non-zero column
    matrix *stem:[U]* such that *stem:[AU]* = λ*stem:[U]*
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "eigenvector" is used because a square matrix represents often a tensor
    quantity transforming a vector quantity into another vector quantity. In this
    case the eigenvectors of the matrix are vectors.
