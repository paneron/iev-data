data:
  definition: the disappearance of the supply voltage for a time interval whose duration
    is between two specified limits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A short interruption is considered to be a reduction of the supply voltage to
    less than 1 % of the nominal voltage, with the lower limit of the duration typically
    a few tenths of a second, and its upper limit typically in the order of one minute
    (or, in some cases up to three minutes).
