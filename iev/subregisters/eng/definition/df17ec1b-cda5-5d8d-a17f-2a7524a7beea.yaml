  definition: current through a short circuit established between two electrodes immediately
    after they have been applied to an insulating material, or after storage during
    some time with the electrodes disconnected from a voltage source and from each
    other
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The de-electrification current may arise, for example from residual polarization
    of the insulating material, or from static charges.
