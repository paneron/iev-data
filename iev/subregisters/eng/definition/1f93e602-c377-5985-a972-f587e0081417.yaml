data:
  definition: phenomenon in a system, where an integral element is followed by a non-linear
    element operating within its saturation range, resulting in the delay of response
    of the output variable to a change of sign of the input variable
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a control loop this delay of response of the output variable may cause excessive
    overshooting of the controlled variable.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-16 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
