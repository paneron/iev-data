  definition: the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages
    between the neutral point (real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals
    of two windings, a positive-sequence voltage system being applied to the high-voltage
    terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered,
    or in numerical sequence if they are numbered. The phasors are assumed to rotate
    in a counter-clockwise sense
