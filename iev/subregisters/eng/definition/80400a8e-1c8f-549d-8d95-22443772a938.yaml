  definition: at a given point of a filiform tube of current, vector quantity equal
    to the product of the electric current and the vector line element at that point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A current element is expressed by  stem:[I]dstem:[*r*]  or by stem:[I*e*]~t~dstem:[s]
    where stem:[I]  is the electric current and dstem:[*r*] = stem:[*e*]~t~dstem:[s]
    the vector line element.
