  definition: level of the limit, as the width of the band approaches zero, of the
    ratio of a specified quantity distributed within a frequency band to the width
    of the band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The kind of quantity must be specified, such as by (squared) sound pressure spectrum
    level.
  - 'In view of the fact that filters have finite bandwidths, practically the sound
    pressure spectrum level stem:[L]~ps~ is obtained for the centre frequency of the
    band by the formula:


    stem:[L_((ps)) = 10 (log)_((10)) ((( p^2 // B )))/((( p_0^2 // B_0 ))) dB]


    where stem:[p] and stem:[p]~0~ are respectively the given field quantity and the
    reference quantity; stem:[B] et stem:[B]~0~ are respectively the effective bandwidth
    of the filter and the reference bandwidth of 1 Hz.


    When stem:[L]~p~ is the band pressure level observed through the filter, the above
    relation reduces to


    stem:[L_((ps)) = L_p - (log)_((10)) ( B // B_0 ) dB]'
