  definition: of an electroacoustic transducer for sound emission, for a specified
    frequency, quotient of the sound pressure in a free field at a specified distance
    from the effective acoustic centre, and in a specified direction, by the current
    flowing at the electrical input terminals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the effective acoustic centre of the transducer cannot be easily determined,
    the distance is measured from the reference point of the transducer.
