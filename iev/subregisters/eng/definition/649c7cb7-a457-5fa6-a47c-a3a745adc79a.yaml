  definition: measure of the proportions of the amounts of the monochromatic stimulus
    and of the specified achromatic stimulus that, when additively mixed, match the
    colour stimulus considered
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of purple stimuli, the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    whose chromaticity is represented by a point on the purple boundary.
  - The proportions can be measured in various ways (see "<a href="IEV845-23-065">colorimetric
    purity</a>" and "<a href="IEV845-23-065">excitation purity</a>").
