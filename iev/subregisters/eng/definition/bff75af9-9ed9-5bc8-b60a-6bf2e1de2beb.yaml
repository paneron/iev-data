  definition: ratio of the RMS value of the alternating component of a {{pulsating,
    IEV:103-06-07}} quantity to the RMS value of the quantity itself
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a pulsating quantity stem:[x] with RMS value stem:[X_((e f f))] and alternating
    component stem:[x_( ∼ )], the pulsating factor is stem:[s = X_( ∼ ) ()_((eff))
    // X_((eff))].
