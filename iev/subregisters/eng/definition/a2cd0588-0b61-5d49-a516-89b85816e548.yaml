data:
  definition: temperature, as measured on the enclosure, at which certain resonator
    measurements are made
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For controlled temperature resonators, the reference temperature is the mid-point
    of the controlled temperature range. For non-controlled temperature resonators,
    the reference temperature is normally 25 °C ± 2 °C.
