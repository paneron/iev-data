  definition: passive stem:[n]-terminal circuit element characterized by stem:[n] − 1
    functional relations between the voltages ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between
    each of stem:[n] − 1 terminals and the remaining terminal, and the electric charges
    ({{131-12-11, IEV:131-12-11}}) at these stem:[n] − 1 terminals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric energy absorbed by a capacitive n-terminal element is stored in electrostatic
    form and is completely recoverable.
