  definition: 'three empirical laws that describe colour-matching properties of additive
    mixtures of colour stimuli:




    * to specify a colour match, three independent variables are necessary and sufficient,


    * for an additive mixture of colour stimuli, only their tristimulus values are
    relevant, not their spectral compositions,


    * in an additive mixture of colour stimuli, if one or more components of the mixture
    are gradually changed, the resulting tristimulus values also change gradually'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Grassman's laws do not hold for all observing conditions.
