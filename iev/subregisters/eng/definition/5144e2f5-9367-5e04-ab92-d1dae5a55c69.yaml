  definition: the ratio of the total noise power appearing at the output of a given
    linear two port device within a specified frequency band, to the portion of this
    power originating from the one-port device connected to the input of the two port
    device, the noise temperature of the one-port device being assumed equal at all
    frequencies to the reference thermodynamic temperature conventionally fixed around
    290 K
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The mean noise factor stem:[bar F] is related to the mean noise temperature stem:[T]
    as follows:


    stem:[bar F = 1 + (bar T)/((T_0))]


    where stem:[T]~0~ is the reference thermodynamic temperature.'
  - The value of the mean noise factor may be expressed in decibels. In English the
    term "noise factor" is generally employed when the ratio is expressed arithmetically
    and "noise figure" is employed when the ratio is expressed in decibels.
