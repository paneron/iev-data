  definition: 'quotient of the <a href="IEV845-29-106">optical thickness</a> of the
    atmosphere at angle stem:[ε] to the vertical, stem:[δ](stem:[ε]), and the vertical
    optical thickness, stem:[δ](0°), of the atmosphere


    stem:[m = ((delta ( epsilon )))/((delta ( 0 ° )))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-29-106">optical thickness</a>".
  - 'Several equations are available to express this concept. Usually the Kasten–Young
    formula is used:


    stem:[m = (1)/((sin\ gamma_s \ + \ 0, 5 0 5\ 72 ( gamma_s \ + \ 6 ,0 79\ 95 )^(-
    1 , 636 4)))]


    where stem:[γ]~s~ (= 90° − stem:[ε]) is solar altitude (complementary angle of
    zenith angle, stem:[ε]) in degree.'
  - 'When the curvature of the atmosphere and atmospheric refraction are neglected:


    stem:[m = (1)/((cos epsilon))].'
  - The relative optical air mass has unit one.
