  definition: a directional-null receiving antenna designed to be insensitive to the
    horizontal components of the electric field, formed from one or more pairs of
    vertical radiating elements regularly spaced on a horizontal circle, the diametrically
    opposite elements being connected in phase opposition, all pairs of elements being
    coupled to a common output through the field coils of a radiogoniometer to obtain
    a steerable directional null
