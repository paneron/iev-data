  definition: 'complex value where the real part is the refractive index and the imaginary
    part is related to the spectral absorption index


    stem:[hat n ( lambda ) = n ( lambda ) - i kappa ( lambda )]


    where where stem:[n](stem:[λ]) is the refractive index at wavelength stem:[λ],
    stem:[κ](stem:[λ]) is the spectral absorption index and stem:[i = sqrt(- 1)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The complex refractive index has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-103 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
