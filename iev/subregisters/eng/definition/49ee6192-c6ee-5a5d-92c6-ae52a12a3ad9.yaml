  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of the magnitude stem:[F]~t~
    of the friction force to the magnitude stem:[F]~n~ of the normal force, thus stem:[Î¼]
    = stem:[F]~t~ / stem:[F]~n~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The friction force is the tangential component and the normal force is the normal
    component of the contact force between two sliding bodies.
