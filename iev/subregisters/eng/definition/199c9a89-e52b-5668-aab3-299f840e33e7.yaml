  definition: time difference between the end time, stem:[t]~e~, and the start time,
    stem:[t]~s~, of an <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> exposure
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a single pulse, the exposure duration is the duration between the half-peak
    power point of the leading edge and the corresponding point on the trailing edge.
    For a train of pulses (or subsections of a train of pulses), the exposure duration
    is the duration between the first half-peak power point of the leading pulse and
    the last half-peak power point of the trailing pulse.
  - The exposure duration is expressed in seconds (s).
