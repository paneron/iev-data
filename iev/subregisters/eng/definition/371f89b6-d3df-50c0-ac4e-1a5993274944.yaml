  definition: at a point in a perfect dielectric medium close to the surface separating
    this medium from a medium of finite conductivity, the angle between the major
    axis of the polarization ellipse of a surface wave and the normal to the separating
    surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In this case, the plane of the polarization ellipse contains the direction of
    propagation.
  - In the case of a surface wave travelling over plane ground, the tangent of the
    angle between the major axis of the polarization ellipse and the normal to the
    surface is not very different from the ratio of the moduli of the longitudinal
    and transverse components of the electric field, which may be used as another
    measure of the wave tilt.
