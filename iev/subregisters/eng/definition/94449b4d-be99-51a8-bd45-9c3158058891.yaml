  definition: component having contacts for making or breaking a specified ignition
    capable circuit, but in which the contacting mechanism is designed and constructed
    so that the component is not capable of causing ignition of the specified explosive
    gas atmosphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The enclosure of the non-incendive component is not intended to either exclude
    the explosive gas atmosphere or contain an explosion. This is usually applied
    to specially constructed switch contacts that are mechanically designed to quench
    any arc or spark so that they are not a source of ignition.
