  definition: least upper bound, if it exists, of the lengths of any polygonal lines
    determined by successive points of the curve between the two points corresponding
    to the limiting values of the parameter interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a curve from A to B defined by the position vector stem:[r = f ( u )] as a
    function of the parameter stem:[u] in the given interval &amp;lsqb;stem:[a], stem:[b]&amp;rsqb;
    where stem:[a &lt;= b], the length of the curve is the line integral stem:[int_A^B
    | d r | = int_a^b | ((d f))/((d u)) | d u].
  - In the usual geometrical space, the length of a curve is a quantity of the dimension
    length.
