  definition: conventional physical constant which relates the {{thermodynamic temperature,
    IEV:113-04-14}} and {{energy, IEV:113-03-45}}, the value of which is set to 1,380 649 × 10^−23^ {{J,
    IEV:113-03-46}}/{{K, IEV:112-02-08}}

  notes:
  - 'The Boltzmann constant relates the average kinetic energy stem:[E] of particles
    in an ideal gas to the thermodynamic temperature stem:[T] of the gas as follows:


    stem:[E = (3)/(2) k T].'
  - The Boltzmann constant is used in the {{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} to define the {{kelvin,
    IEV:112-02-08}}.
