data:
  definition: an electron accelerator in which the magnetic fields normal to the circular
    orbit of the electrons and within that orbit increase with time; the field at
    the orbit maintains a stable orbit while the changing magnetic field inside the
    orbit accelerates the electrons in the orbit
