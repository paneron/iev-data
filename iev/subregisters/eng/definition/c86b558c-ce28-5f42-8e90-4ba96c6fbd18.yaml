  definition: system for determining the <a href="IEV845-23-038">tristimulus values</a>
    of any spectral power distribution using the set of reference colour stimuli &amp;lsqb;X~10~&amp;rsqb;,
    &amp;lsqb;Y~10~&amp;rsqb;, &amp;lsqb;Z~10~&amp;rsqb; and the three CIE colour-matching
    functions stem:[bar x_((10)) ( lambda ) , bar y_((10)) ( lambda ) , bar z_((10))
    ( lambda )] adopted by the CIE in 1964
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The CIE 1964 standard colorimetric system is applicable to centrally viewed fields
    of angular subtense greater than about 4Â° (0,07 rad).
  - When the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric system is used, all symbols that represent
    colorimetric measures are distinguished by use of the subscript 10.
  - See also CIE 15, stem:[Colorimetry].
