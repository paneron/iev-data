  definition: 'for a two-terminal element or a two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, product of the voltage stem:[u_((AB))] between the terminals and the
    electric current stem:[i] in the element or circuit


    stem:[p = u_((AB)) * i]


    where stem:[u_((AB))] is the line integral of the electric field strength from
    A to B, and where the electric current in the element or circuit is taken positive
    if its direction is from A to B and negative if its direction is from B to A'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The direction of electric current is as defined in {{131-11-29, IEV:131-11-29}}.
  - In circuit theory the electric field strength is generally irrotational and thus
    stem:[u_((AB)) = v_A - v_B], where stem:[v_A] and stem:[v_B] are the electric
    potentials at terminals A and B, respectively.
  - The coherent SI unit of instantaneous power is watt, W.
