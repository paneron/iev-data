  definition: "under steady-state conditions, the r.m.s. value of the difference between:\r\
    \n. the instantaneous values of the primary current, and\r\n. the instantaneous\
    \ values of the actual secondary current multiplied by the rated transformation\
    \ ratio,\r\n\r\nthe positive signs of the primary and secondary currents corresponding\
    \ to the convention for terminal markings"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The composite error is generally expressed as a percentage of the r.m.s. value
    of the primary current.
