    a set of very numerous and randomly located obstacles or other irregularities
    gives rise to waves not interpretable by geometrical optics

  notes:
  - Scattering continuously distributes the energy of the incident wave in all directions
    with no well-defined phase relation between the waves scattered in different directions.
