  definition: a signal unit containing a bit pattern designed to facilitate rapid
    synchronisation, which is sent over a signalling link to establish bit, signal
    unit or block synchronism, as appropriate, between the transmitting and receiving
    terminals, and possibly sent subsequently to maintain synchronism when no signal
    messages are available for transmission
