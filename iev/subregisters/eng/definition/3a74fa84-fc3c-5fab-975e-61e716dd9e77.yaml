  definition: 'logarithm of the number of events in a finite set of stem:[n] mutually
    exclusive events


    stem:[H]~0~&amp;equals;log stem:[n]




    stem:[[[H_0,=,( lb 3 ),Sh,tildetilde,1,,585, ,Sh],[ , , ,=,( ln 3 ),nat,tildetilde,1,,099,
    ,nat],[ , , ,=,( lg 3 ),Hart,tildetilde,0,,477, ,Hart]]]'
  examples:
  - 'The decision content of a set of three events is:'
  notes:
  - 'The base of the logarithm determines the unit used. Commonly used units are:
    shannon (symbol Sh) for logarithms of base 2, natural unit (symbol nat) for logarithms
    of base e, hartley (symbol Hart) for logarithms of base 10.


    Conversion table:


    stem:[[[1 Sh,tildetilde,0,693 nat,tildetilde,0,301 Hart],[1 nat,tildetilde,1,433
    Sh,tildetilde,0,434 Hart],[1 Hart,tildetilde,3,322 Sh,tildetilde,2,303 nat]]]'
  - The decision content is independent of the probabilities of the occurrence of
    the events.
  - The number of decisions needed to select a specific event out of a finite set
    of mutually exclusive events equals the smallest integer which is greater than
    or equal to the decision content when the base of the logarithm is the number
    of choices on each decision.
  - When the same integer base is used for the same number of events, the decision
    content equals the {{maximum entropy, IEV:171-07-16}}.
