  definition: for a decaying population of particles of the same kind, duration for
    the number of particles to decrease to 1/e of the initial value, where e is the
    base of natural logarithms
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The mean life is the time constant for the decay of particles.
  - 2 Only exponential decays are known. However, for a combination of different kinds
    of particles with different mean life, the decay is not exponential, and the resulting
    mean life varies with time.
