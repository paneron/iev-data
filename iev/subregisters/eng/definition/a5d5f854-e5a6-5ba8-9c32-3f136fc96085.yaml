data:
  definition: a device for measuring power which contains a power-absorbing element
    in which the resistance change related to the temperature coefficient of resistivity
    is used as a means of measuring the power
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The absorbing element may be a barretter with a positive temperature coefficient,
    a thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient, or other similar device.
