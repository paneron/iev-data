  definition: 'for a vector field *stem:[U]* that is given at each point of a three-dimensional
    domain V limited by a closed surface S having an orientation towards exterior,
    theorem stating that the volume integral over V of the divergence of the field
    *stem:[U]* is equal to the flux of this field through the surface S


    stem:[underset(V)( ∭ ) div U d V = underset(S)( ∯ ) U * e_n d A]


    where dstem:[V] is the volume element and *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector
    surface element'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The divergence theorem can be generalized to the stem:[n]-dimensional Euclidean
    space.
  - In electrostatics, the divergence theorem is applied to express that the electric
    flux through a closed surface is equal to the total electric charge in the domain
    enclosed by the surface. It is then called "Gauss law".
