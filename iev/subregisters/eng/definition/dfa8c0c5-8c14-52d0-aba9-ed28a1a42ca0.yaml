data:
  definition: the speed of light in vacuum, divided by the magnitude of the group
    velocity of the mode
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For a plane wave of wavelength stem:[λ], it is related thus to the refractive
    index stem:[n]:


    stem:[N = n - lambda ((d n))/((d lambda))]


    where stem:[λ] is the wavelength.'
  - Each mode has its own group index.
