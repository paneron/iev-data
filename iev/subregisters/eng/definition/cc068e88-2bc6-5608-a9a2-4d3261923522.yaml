  definition: quotient of that part of the radiant flux or luminous flux from a surface,
    the radiance or luminance of which is the same at all points and for all directions,
    which falls on the surface itself, and the radiant exitance or luminous exitance
    of the surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The self-exchange coefficient of a surface, S, limited by a flat curve, C, and
    situated on only one side of the plane of this curve is equal to the surface area
    of S minus the flat surface area limited by C.
  - The self-exchange coefficient is expressed in square metre (m^2^).
