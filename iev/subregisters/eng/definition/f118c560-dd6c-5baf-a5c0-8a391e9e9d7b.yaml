  definition: 'for an electroacoustic transducer that is linear, passive and reversible,
    principle according to which:


    a) the relation between the voltage sensitivity of the transducer functioning
    as a receiver of sound (e.g. a microphone), and the sensitivity to current of
    the transducer functioning as an emitter of sound, and


    b) the relation between the current sensitivity of the transducer functioning
    as a receiver of sound (e.g. a microphone) and the sensitivity to voltage of the
    transducer functioning as an emitter of sound depend only on the geometry of the
    transducer, the frequency, and physical properties of the medium'
