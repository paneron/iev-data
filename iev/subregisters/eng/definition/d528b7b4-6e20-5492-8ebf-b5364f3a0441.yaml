  definition: co-ordination of the operating characteristics of two or more overcurrent

    the device intended to operate within these limits does so, while the other(s)
    does (do) not
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Distinction is made between series discrimination, involving different overcurrent
    protective devices passing substantially the same overcurrent, and network discrimination
    involving identical protective devices passing different proportions of the overcurrent.
