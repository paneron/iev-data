  definition: special ballast designed for the purpose of providing comparison standards
    for use in testing ballasts, for the selection of reference lamps and for testing
    electric lamps from regular production under standardized conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A reference ballast is typically inductive for electric lamps operating on AC
    mains frequencies or resistive for electric lamps operating on high-frequency
    or low-frequency square waves.
  - A reference ballast operated at its rated frequency has a stable voltage/current
    ratio that is relatively uninfluenced by variations in current, temperature and
    magnetic surroundings.
