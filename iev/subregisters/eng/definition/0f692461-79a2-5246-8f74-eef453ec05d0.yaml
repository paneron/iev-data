  definition: '{{direct fuel cell, IEV:485-08-04}} in which the fuel is methanol (CH~3~OH),
    in gaseous or liquid form'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The methanol is oxidized directly at the {{anode, IEV:485-02-04}} with no reformation
    to hydrogen. The {{electrolyte, IEV:485-03-01}} is typically a proton exchange
    membrane.
