  definition: technique of {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} hydrophilized {{substrates,
    IEV:521-05-28}} made of silicon, oxidized silicon, and so on by primary hydrogen
    bonds between the surfaces, and then by Si-O-Si bonds after {{annealing, IEV:841-22-23}}
    at high temperature
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Silicon fusion bonding is used to form impurity diffusion layers or insulation
    layers inside a {{wafer, IEV:521-05-29}} by bonding two silicon wafers, one or
    both of which may be oxidized. The technology is also used to bond wafers that
    contain impurities of different species or concentrations, as an alternative process
    to in-depth impurity diffusion or epitaxial growth where high temperatures and
    a long process time are required. The main problem with silicon fusion bonding
    is its high process temperature; all lower-temperature processes should take place
    after the bonding. Studies are ongoing to lower the process temperature by the
    application of plasma oxidation treatment before bonding, and to apply the technology
    to bond non-silicon materials. By bonding oxidized wafers, the {{silicon-on-insulator,
    IEV:523-04-20}} (SOI) structure can be obtained, in which an insulation layer
    is sandwiched by two silicon layers. The SOI structure is used to separate integrated
    element {{components, IEV:151-11-21}} by oxide and other  {{dielectric materials,
    IEV:561-01-16}} to improve performance; for example, to manufacture {{photodiode,
    IEV:521-04-32}} arrays and so on. Another application of the technology is bonding
    wafers that have been bored or cut with grooves, to obtain precise structures
    made inside a wafer. This technique is used to make pressure  {{sensors, IEV:151-13-48}},
    and heat exchangers for laser diodes with an internal cooling structure, and so
    on.
