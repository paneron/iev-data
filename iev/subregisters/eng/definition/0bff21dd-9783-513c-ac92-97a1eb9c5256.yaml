  definition: relationship between oscillator frequency and time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This long-term frequency drift is caused by the secular changes in the crystal
    unit and/or elements of the oscillator circuit, and should be expressed as a fractional
    change in mean frequency per specified time interval.
