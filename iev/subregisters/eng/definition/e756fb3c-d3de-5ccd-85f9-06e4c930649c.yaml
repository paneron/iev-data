  definition: potential for a thermally induced retinal injury resulting from <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical
    radiation</a> exposure at wavelengths primarily between 380 nm and 1 400 nm
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The retinal thermal hazard is only likely to be of concern for lasers or high-radiance
    arc lamps.
