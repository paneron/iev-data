  definition: 'at a given point within a surface element of quasi-infinitesimal area
    stem:[S], vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers confined
    to the surface element, of the products of electric charge and velocity, divided
    by the area stem:[S]:


    stem:[A = (1)/(S) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i]


    where stem:[n] is the number of free carriers confined to the surface element,
    stem:[Q]~stem:[i]~  the electric charge of the stem:[i]^th^  carrier and *stem:[v]*~i~
    its velocity'

  notes:
  - 'For charge carriers confined to a surface, the integral along a curve of this
    surface joining two points stem:[a] and stem:[b], the differential element of
    which is the scalar product of the lineic electric current stem:[*A*]  and the
    vector stem:[*e*]~n~dstem:[s] normal to the curve in a specified direction tangent
    to the surface and of magnitude equal to the scalar line element dstem:[s], is
    equal to the limit of the quotient of the electric charge stem:[Q] transferred
    across the curve in the specified direction during a time interval by the duration
    stem:[τ]  of this interval when stem:[τ]  tends to zero:


    stem:[int_((s_a))^((s_b)) A * e_n d s = underset((tau -&gt; 0))((lim)) (Q)/(tau)]


    where stem:[s]~a~ and stem:[s]~b~ are the path coordinates for stem:[a] and stem:[b],
    respectively.'
