  definition: physical constant equal to stem:[eh]/4πstem:[m]~e~ where stem:[e] is
    the elementary charge, stem:[h] is the Planck constant and stem:[m]~e~  is the
    electron rest mass; its value is approximately equal to 9,274 015 x 10^-24^ Am^2^
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The magnetic area moment of a free electron due to its spin is approximately equal
    to 1,001 159 652 stem:[μ]~B~.
