  notes:
  - In English, the term “hazard” can be qualified in order to define the origin of
    the hazard or the nature of the expected harm (e.g. “electric shock hazard”, “crushing
    hazard”, “cutting hazard”, “toxic hazard”, “fire hazard”, “drowning hazard”).
  - In French, the synonym “risque” is used together with a qualifier or a complement
    to define the origin of the hazard or the nature of the expected harm (e.g. “risque
    de choc électrique”, “risque d'écrasement”, “risque de coupure”, “risque toxique”,
    “risque d'incendie”, “risque de noyade”).
  - In French, the term “risque” also denotes the combination of the probability of
    occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm, in English “risk” (see {{903-01-07,
    IEV:903-01-07}}).
