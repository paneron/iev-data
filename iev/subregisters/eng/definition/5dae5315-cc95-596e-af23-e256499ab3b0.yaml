data:
  definition: ratio of the mass concentration of water vapour stem:[v] to its mass
    concentration at saturation stem:[v]~sat~, at the same temperature, thus stem:[Ïˆ]
    = stem:[v]/stem:[v]~sat~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For normal cases, the relative humidity may be assumed to be equal to relative
    mass concentration of vapour.
