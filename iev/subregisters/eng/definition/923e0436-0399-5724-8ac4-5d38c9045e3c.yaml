  definition: medium in which a time-varying electric field produces an electric current
    density the component vector of which in a given direction has a magnitude large
    compared with that of the component vector of the displacement current density
    in this direction, in a particular frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Under sinusoidal conditions in an isotropic medium, the medium is conductive
    if the following relation is satisfied:


    stem:[(gamma)/((epsilon_0 omega)) ≫ epsilon^( '' )_r]


    where stem:[γ] is the conductivity, stem:[ε]~0~ the electric constant, stem:[ω]
    the angular frequency and stem:[ε′]~r~ the real relative permittivity. Under static
    conditions the medium is conducting if the conductivity is not zero.'
  - An anisotropic medium can be conducting only in certain directions.
  - The term “conductor” also denotes any element intended to carry electric current.
