data:
  definition: capacitor consisting of a metallic plate as first conductor, a very
    thin oxide film formed on the metal as the dielectric and an electrolyte as second
    conductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Electrolytic capacitors typically have large capacitance because the dielectric
    is very thin.
  - "The electrolytic capacitor is not to be confused with electrochemical capacitors\
    \ \n(114-03-03)."
  - Definition 436-03-05 in IEC 60050-436:1990 doesnâ€™t mention electrolyte.
