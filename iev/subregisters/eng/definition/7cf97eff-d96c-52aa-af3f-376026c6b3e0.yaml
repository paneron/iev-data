data:
  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the partial gain of an
    antenna, in a given direction and for a specified linear polarization, to the
    maximum absolute gain of an antenna consisting of a linear conductor, much shorter
    than one quarter of the wavelength, normal to the surface of a perfectly conducting
    plane, and oriented in a direction parallel to the electric flux density vector
    characterizing the specified polarization in the given direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
