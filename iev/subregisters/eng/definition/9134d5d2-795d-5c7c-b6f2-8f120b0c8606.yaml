  definition: the ratios of the coefficients of the linear combination of independent
    modes of propagation that represents a degenerate mode in a waveguide
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If there are exactly stem:[n] independent modes of propagation there will be at
    most stem:[n] â€”1 independent ratios that describe completely the polarization
    of a given degenerate mode.
  - In a waveguide with square or circular cross-section there are two independent
    modes of propagation, and a single ratio describes the polarization of a given
    degenerate mode.
