  notes:
  - The ability to recover may or may not require external actions. For recovery where
    no external actions are required, see self-recoverability ({{192-01-26, IEV:192-01-26}}).
  - Recoverability may be quantified using measures such as the probability of recovery
    within a specified time interval.
