data:
  definition: quantity equal to normal stress stem:[σ] divided by linear strain stem:[ε],
    under given conditions, thus stem:[E] = stem:[σ] / stem:[ε]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Usually, an isothermal process is considered.
  - 2 In anisotropic media, modulus of elasticity may depend on the orientation.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of modulus of elasticity is pascal, Pa.
