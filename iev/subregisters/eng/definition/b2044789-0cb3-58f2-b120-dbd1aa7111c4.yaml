  definition: semiconductor device that is specified to perform an elementary function
    and that is not divisible into separate components functional in themselves
  examples: []
  notes:
  - There is no clear delimitation possible between discrete devices and integrated
    circuits. In principle, a discrete device consists of a single circuit element
    only. However, a device sold and specified as a discrete device may internally
    consist of more than one circuit element.
