  definition: 'real number stem:[ϑ] such that 0 ≤ stem:[ϑ] ≤ π, the cosine of which
    is the ratio of the scalar product of two given real vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]*
    to the product of their magnitudes


    stem:[vartheta = arccos ((U * V))/((| U | * | V |))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The angle of two vectors is always defined because the inequality stem:[| U *
    V | &lt;= | U | * | V |] is valid for the scalar product.
