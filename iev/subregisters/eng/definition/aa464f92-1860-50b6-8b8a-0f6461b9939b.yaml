data:
  definition: protection, generally distance protection, using telecommunication,
    with overreach protection at each section end and in which a blocking signal is
    transmitted continuously to the other section end until a fault is detected by
    the overreach protection which removes the blocking signal and sends an unblocking
    signal to the other end. Removal of the blocking signal together with the receipt
    of the unblocking signal permits the initiation of tripping by the local protection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If no unblocking signal is received following removal of the blocking signal,
    it is usually arranged to permit the overreach protection to initiate tripping
    within a variable time interval usually in the range 100-200 ms.
