        type: modified
  concept: 150d8849-ef01-5180-abd2-85e6c3de282c
  definition: acoustic energy flow rate in the direction of propagation per unit area
    normal to the direction of propagation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Instantaneous intensity is the product of instantaneous acoustic pressure and
    instantaneous particle velocity. It is difficult to measure intensity in the ultrasound
    frequency range. For measurement purposes and if it is reasonable to assume that
    the instantaneous acoustic pressure and instantaneous particle velocity are substantially
    in phase along the beam(-alignment) axis for a given frequency, than the instantaneous
    intensity, [stem:[I(t)]], is approximated as


    stem:[p(t)]^2^/stem:[ρc]


    where


    stem:[p(t)] is the instantaneous acoustic pressure;


    stem:[ρ] is the density of the medium;


    stem:[c] is the velocity of sound in the medium.'
