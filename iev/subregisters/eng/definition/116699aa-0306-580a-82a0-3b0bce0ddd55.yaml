  definition: diagonal term of the inductance matrix
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For a winding of stem:[N]~stem:[i]~ turns following the same path, the self-inductance
    and the self-permeance are related by the formula: stem:[L]~stem:[ii]~ = stem:[N]~stem:[i]~^2^stem:[Î›]~stem:[ii]~'
  - For an ideal inductor, the self-inductance is equal to the inductance as defined
    in 131-12-19.
