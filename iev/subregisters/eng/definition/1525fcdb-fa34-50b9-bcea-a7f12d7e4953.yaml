  definition: an electromagnetic wave associated with a fast wave guided along a surface
    and characterized by radiation of energy from this surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the radio-frequency domain, leaky waves may be created by a periodic structure,
    consisting, for example, of apertures distributed along the length of a line guiding
    a fast wave.
