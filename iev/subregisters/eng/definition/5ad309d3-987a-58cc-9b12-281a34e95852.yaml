  definition: '{{fundamental physical constant, IEV:112-03-09}} determining the general
    properties of {{space-time, IEV:113-01-01}} and affecting all particles and fields,
    whose value is set to 299 792 458 {{m, IEV:112-02-05}}/{{s, IEV:112-02-04}}'

  notes:
  - Any electromagnetic wave or gravitational wave propagates in vacuum with the speed
    of light in vacuum. The speed of light in vacuum is also the upper limit of speed
    for any transfer of matter, energy, or information.
  - The speed of light in vacuum is used in the {{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} to define the
    {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}}.
  - 'The term “luminal speed" is used in relativity theory. Related concepts are "{{subluminal
    speed, IEV:113-01-37}}" and "{{superluminal speed, IEV:113-01-36}}".


    The term "speed of light" shall be used only when the context indicates without
    ambiguity that the full term “speed of light in vacuum” is meant, because "speed
    of light" is also observed in matter where its value is always less than that
    in vacuum.


    The term “light speed” is deprecated because it is not a short form of the preferred
    term.'
