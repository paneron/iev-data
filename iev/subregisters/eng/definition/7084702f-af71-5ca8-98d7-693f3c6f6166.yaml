data:
  definition: value of the input voltage at which an electromagnetic relay attains
    a defined magnetic condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For polarized relays, distinction is made between preconditioning in forward (operate)
    direction, and preconditioning in reverse direction.
  - For bistable relays, preconditioning may also be used to put the relay into a
    defined position.
