  definition: the ratio of the complex value of a given component of the electric
    field of a reflected wave to that of the corresponding component of the incident
    wave, at a point close to a reflective specular surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of transmission lines, reflection factor is defined similarly as the
    ratio of the reflected wave and the direct wave at a port or transverse cross-section.
