  definition: filter consisting of input and output IDTs on a piezoelectric substrate
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The impulse response of a transversal filter is given by the convolution of the
    impulse response of the first IDT with the conjugate complex impulse response
    of the second IDT. The frequency response is given by the Fourier transform of
    the impulse response. A simple example of a transversal filter is shown in Figure
    16.
