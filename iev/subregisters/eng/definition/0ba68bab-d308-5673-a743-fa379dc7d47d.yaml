data:
  definition: the reaches of the measuring elements of non-unit protection, generally
    distance protection, in a power system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These non-unit protections, generally distance protection, often have two, three
    or even more zones available. These are usually arranged such that the shortest
    zone corresponds to an impedance slightly smaller than the impedance of the protected
    section, and is normally instantaneous in operation. Zones with longer reach settings
    are normally time-delayed to obtain selectivity.
