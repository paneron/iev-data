  definition: property of a function stem:[f ( t )] for a value stem:[t]~0~ of its
    argument, characterised by the existence of a positive number stem:[Îµ] such that
    stem:[f ( t_0 ) &gt; f ( t )] for any stem:[t] with stem:[0 | t - t_0 | epsilon]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the condition stem:[f ( t_0 ) &gt; f ( t )] is replaced with stem:[f ( t_0
    ) &gt;= f ( t )], the property may occur for an interval of values of the argument.
