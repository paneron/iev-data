  definition: for a parallel beam of specified radiation in a given substance, the
    quantity stem:[μ]~abs~ describes the fraction of energy absorbed in passing through
    a thin layer of thickness Δstem:[x]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The absorption coefficient is primarily energy dependent.
  - According to whether the thickness Δstem:[x] is expressed in terms of length,
    mass per unit area, moles per unit area or atoms per unit area, it is called the
    linear, mass, molar or atomic absorption coefficient.
