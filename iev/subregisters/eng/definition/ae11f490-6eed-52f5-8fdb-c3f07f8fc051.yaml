  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the power of the carrier
    of a wanted signal to the power of an interfering signal, evaluated in specified
    conditions, these powers being considered at the input of the receiver
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If several interference signals are present, the sum of their powers should be
    considered.
  - 'The specified conditions comprise among others:


    – the nature and characteristics of the interfering signal,


    – the receiver and antenna characteristics such as the bandwidth.'
