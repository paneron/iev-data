  definition: '{{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} {{unit, IEV:112-01-14}} of {{luminous intensity,
    IEV:723-08-28}}, equal to the luminous intensity in a given direction, of a source
    that emits {{monochromatic radiation, IEV:731-01-08}} of frequency 540 × 10^12^
    Hz and has a {{radiant intensity, IEV:731-01-23}} in that direction of 1/683 {{W,
    IEV:113-03-55}}/{{, IEV:sr}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit
    of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed
    numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency
    540 × 10^12^ Hz, stem:[K]~cd~, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm W^−1^,
    which is equal to cd sr W^−1^, or cd sr kg^−1^m^−2^ s^3^, where the kilogram,
    metre and second are defined in terms of stem:[h], stem:[c] and Δstem:[ν]~Cs~."'
  - This definition implies that 683 lm/W is the exact value of the {{luminous efficacy
    of monochromatic radiation, IEV:845-01-56}} stem:[K]~m~.
  - 'The candela is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: {{second, IEV:112-02-04}}
    (s), {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}} (m), {{kilogram, IEV:112-02-06}} (kg), {{ampere,
    IEV:112-02-08}} (A), {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), {{mole, IEV:112-02-09}} (mol)
    and candela (cd).'
