  definition: ratio of the r.m.s. value of the total distortion content to the r.m.s.
    value of the fundamental component or the reference fundamental component of an
    alternating quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The total distortion ratio depends on the choice of the fundamental component.
    If it is not clear from the context which one is used an indication should be
    given.
  - The total distortion ratio may be approximated to a certain harmonic order. This
    is to be stated.
