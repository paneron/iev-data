  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of forced
    convection and thermal conduction, defined by stem:[P e = ((rho c_p v l))/(lambda)
    = ((v l))/(alpha)], where stem:[ρ] is mass density, stem:[cp] is specific heat
    capacity at constant pressure, stem:[v] is speed, stem:[l] is a specified length,
    stem:[λ] is thermal conductivity, and stem:[α] is thermal diffusivity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Péclet number is the product of the Reynolds number stem:[Re] and the Prandtl
    number stem:[Pr], thus stem:[Pe] = stem:[Re] ⋅ stem:[Pr].
