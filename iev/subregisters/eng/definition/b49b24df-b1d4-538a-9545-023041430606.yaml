  definition: ionization chamber using a lining of fissionable material to detect
    neutrons
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ionization is initiated mainly by fission fragments produced by nuclear reaction
    of neutrons with fissionable material.
  - Depending on the fissionable radionuclide, it is possible to detect thermal neutrons,
    fast neutrons or neutrons of all energies.
  - See definition of fissile nuclide (IEC 60050-393:2003, 393-11-26) and fissionable
    nuclide (IEC 60050-393:2003, 393-11-28).
  - This entry was numbered 394-25-10 in IEC 60050-394:2007.
