  definition: product of the modulus of the common emitter small-signal short-circuit
    forward current transfer ratio |stem:[h]~21stem:[e]~| and the frequency of the
    measurement, this frequency being so chosen that |stem:[h]~21stem:[e]~| is decreasing
    at a slope of approximately 6 dB per octave
