  definition: the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave due uniquely to the fact
    that with increasing distance the energy is distributed over a wider area
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a homogeneous and isotropic medium, the spreading loss is characterized by
    a decrease of the power flux density in proportion to the reciprocal of the square
    of the distance to the source.
