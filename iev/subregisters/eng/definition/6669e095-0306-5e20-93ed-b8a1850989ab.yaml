  definition: intrinsic angular momentum of a particle
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The expectation value of spin in any direction is stem:[ℏ sqrt(s ( s + 1 ))]
    where stem:[s] is spin quantum number and stem:[ħ] is reduced Planck constant.
  - 2 The spin in a given direction is quantized as multiples or half-multiples of
    the reduced Planck constant. In the direction of the quantization axis stem:[z],
    the component of the spin is quantized as stem:[S]~stem:[z]~ = stem:[m]~stem:[s]~stem:[ħ],
    stem:[m]~stem:[s]~ = stem:[s], stem:[s] − 1, … − stem:[s], where stem:[m]~stem:[s]~
    is spin magnetic quantum number and stem:[s] is spin quantum number.
