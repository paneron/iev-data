    through that material or substance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Transparency is distinct from clarity in that transparency is related to the amount
    of light transmitted through a medium whereas clarity relates to the ability to
    resolve an object that is seen through the medium. Tinted glass is an example
    of a material that has low transparency but high clarity.
