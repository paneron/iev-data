  definition: 'quantity obtained by spectrally weighting the spectral radiant exposure
    with the actinic action spectrum


    stem:[H_((act)) = int int E_((e , lambda)) ( t ) s_((act)) ( lambda ) d lambda
    d t]


    where stem:[E]~e,stem:[λ]~ is the spectral irradiance in W·m^−2^·nm^−1^ and stem:[s]~act~(stem:[λ])
    is the actinic action spectrum normalized to 1 at its maximum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which actinic action spectrum is used, as the unit
    is the same for any action spectrum.
  - The actinic dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^)
