  definition: 'parameter of a signal that represents information according to a rule


    Note 1 to entry: For many signals the value of a given physical quantity is identical
    with the value of the information parameter. In this case it is usual, for the
    sake of simplicity, to speak of the “value of a signal”.


    Note 2 to entry: For an amplitude-modulated alternating voltage signal the information
    parameter of the signal is the relationship between the actual amplitude to that
    amplitude the voltage would have without amplitude-modulation. For a duration-
    or position-modulated pulse signal the duration of each pulse or the position
    of each pulse within the pulse period respectively is the information parameter
    of the signal.
