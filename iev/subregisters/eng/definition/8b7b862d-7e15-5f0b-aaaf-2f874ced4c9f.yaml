data:
  definition: pertaining to alternating electric quantities such as voltage or current,
    to devices operated with these, or to quantities associated with these devices
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The notation "AC" is preferred in English to the notation "a.c." which is an abbreviation
    of "alternating current" (see IEC 60050-131).
  - French language uses also the expression "courant alternatif" with an appropriate
    preposition such as "en", "de", "Ã " or "pour", or only the adjective "alternatif".
  - 'For the marking of electric equipment, either the notation AC (see IEC 61293)
    or the graphical symbol ~ (see IEC 60417 item 5032) may be used. Example: AC 500
    V or ~ 500 V.'
  - 'According to ISO 31-0 and IEC 60027-1, unit names and unit symbols shall not
    be qualified by "AC" as an attachment. Example: stem:[U]~AC~ = 500 V is correct,
    stem:[U] = 500 V~AC~ or stem:[U] = 500 V AC are incorrect.'
