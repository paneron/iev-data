  definition: 'density of incident radiant flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[E_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~e~ is radiant flux and stem:[A] is the area on which the radiant
    flux is incident'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "illuminance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon irradiance".
  - The irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-37 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
