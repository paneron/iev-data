  definition: the part stem:[b] of a complex number stem:[c = a + j b], where stem:[a]
    and stem:[b] are real numbers
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The imaginary part of a complex number stem:[c] is denoted by stem:[I m c] (where
    I is an uppercase i) or sometimes by stem:[c]â€³ in electrotechnology.
  - The concept of imaginary part may be applied to complex scalar, vector or tensor
    quantities or to matrices of complex elements.
