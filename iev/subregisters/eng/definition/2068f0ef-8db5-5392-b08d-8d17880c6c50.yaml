  definition: 'density of photon flux with respect to solid angle in a specified direction


    stem:[I_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d omega))]


    where stem:[Φ]~p~ is the photon flux emitted in the given direction, and stem:[Ω]
    is the solid angle containing that direction'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The distribution of the photon intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]), is used to determine
    the photon flux, stem:[Φ]~p~, within a certain solid angle, stem:[Ω], of a source:


    stem:[Phi_p = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_p ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi
    \ d vartheta].'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant intensity". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "luminous intensity".
  - The photon intensity is expressed in second to the power minus one times steradian
    to the power minus one (s^−1^·sr^−1^).
