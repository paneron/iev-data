  definition: "the relative permeability obtained from the peak magnetic flux density\
    \ divided by  \r\nstem:[sqrt(2)] and the RMS value of the applied magnetic field\
    \ strength at a stated peak value of the flux density, when the flux density is\
    \ varying sinusoidally with time with an average value of zero and the material\
    \ is initially in a specified neutralized state"
