  definition: function to work on process variable quantities, which is composed of
    basic functions of process control, specific to particular functional units of
    the plant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In addition to process control functions associated with specific control levels,
    there can also be process control functions that link input and output variables
    across several control levels. For instance, a process control function in the
    feedback path with the controlled variable as input variable and the manipulated
    variable as output variable, describes the action path from the sensing element
    via the controller to the final controlling element. Another process control function
    connects the operator with the indicators for the process variables. In view of
    the diversity of definitions of process control functions, standardization is
    not appropriate at this time.
