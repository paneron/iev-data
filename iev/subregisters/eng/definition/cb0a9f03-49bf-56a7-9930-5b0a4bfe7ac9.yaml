data:
  definition: quotient of the total photon number of all wavelengths emitted from
    a specimen by a fluorescent process for an excitation at wavelength stem:[μ],
    and the photon number of wavelength stem:[μ] reflected from the perfect reflecting
    diffuser identically irradiated and viewed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The spectral quantum efficiency of the fluorescent process has unit one.
