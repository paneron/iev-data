  definition: for any vector *stem:[U]*, non-negative scalar, usually denoted by stem:[|
    U |], equal to the non-negative square root of the scalar product or, in the case
    of a complex vector, of the Hermitian product of the vector by itself
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "The magnitude of a vector *stem:[U]* has the following properties:\n\n\n\n* stem:[U\
    \ = 0] if and only if stem:[| U | = 0],\n\n* stem:[| alpha U | = | alpha | * |\
    \ U |] where stem:[α] is a scalar, \n\n* stem:[| U + V | &lt;= | U | + | V |]\
    \ where *stem:[V]* is any other vector. \n"
  - For a vector *stem:[U]* in the three-dimensional Euclidean or Hermitian space
    with orthonormal base, the magnitude is given by stem:[| U | = sqrt(| U_1 |^2
    + | U_2 |^2 + | U_3 |^2)].
  - The terms "Euclidean norm" and "Hermitian norm" may be used for the real or the
    complex case, respectively.
  - The magnitude of a vector *stem:[U]* is represented by stem:[| U |] or by stem:[U];
    stem:[‖ U ‖] is also used.
