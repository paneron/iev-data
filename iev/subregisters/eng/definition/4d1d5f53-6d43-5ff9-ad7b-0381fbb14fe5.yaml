  definition: production process of a superconducting thin film mainly by using physical
    evaporation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The physical vapour deposition process mainly constitutes a thin film by using
    vacuum evaporation of atomic species or sputter deposition using single or multiple
    targets in inert or reactive atmospheres (e.g. RF-magnetron sputtering, ion beam
    sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy, laser ablation).
