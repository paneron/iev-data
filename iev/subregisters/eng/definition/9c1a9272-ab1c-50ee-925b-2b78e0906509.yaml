  definition: computational reference white point used by a colour appearance model
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A white point used by a colour appearance model is an adopted white point.
  - The adopted white point can or cannot be the <a href="IEV845-23-081">adapted white</a>
    point, and one of the most common applications of an adopted white point is to
    achieve an optimally reproduced device white. For example, an adopted white point
    corresponding to a given medium can be used in place of an adapted white point
    in order that no colorants are used to create a white.
  - The concept of adopted white point applies to both colour appearance models and
    reproduction models.
