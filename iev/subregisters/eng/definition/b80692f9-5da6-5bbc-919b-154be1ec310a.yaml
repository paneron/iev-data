  definition: 'a command which is input at a control centre and which indicates a
    standard instruction to operators in the control room of a manned station


    Examples: "Start generators" or "Adjust generator output to ... MW".'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The instruction command is distinguished from instructions transmitted by general
    communication means (e.g. teleprinter) in that it is input and transmitted by
    means of devices used in telecontrol systems for other purposes and therefore
    must be programmed in a similar manner to other types of commands.
