  definition: length of the path that would be travelled at the {{speed of light in
    vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}} in a {{duration, IEV:113-01-13}} equal to the {{phase
    delay, IEV:702-02-16}} of a given {{electromagnetic wave, IEV:121-11-63}} between
    two given points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Between two points in the same ray path, the optical path length equals the {{line
    integral, IEV:102-05-03}} of the {{refractive index, IEV:702-02-19}} along the
    ray path:


    stem:[underset(c)( int ) n d s]


    where stem:[n] is the refractive index of the medium at each point in the direction
    of the path and dstem:[s] the curve element along the path.'
