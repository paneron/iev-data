data:
  definition: the equivalent star connection impedance related to one of the windings,
    for a given tapping and expressed in ohms per phase, at rated frequency, measured
    between the terminals of a winding when the other winding is short-circuited
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This value is normally related to the appropriate reference temperature.
