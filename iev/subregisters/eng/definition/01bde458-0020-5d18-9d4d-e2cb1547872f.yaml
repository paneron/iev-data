  definition: 'quotient of dstem:[E]~tr~ by dstem:[m] where dstem:[E]~tr~ is the sum
    of the initial kinetic energies of all charged ionizing particles liberated by
    uncharged ionizing particles in a mass dstem:[m] of material


    stem:[K] = dstem:[E]~tr~/dstem:[m]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The unit for kerma is gray (1 Gy = 1 J kg^−1^).
  - Kerma is derived from “kinetic energy released per unit mass”.
  - In the case where the material is air the name is air kerma.
  - This entry was numbered 393-14-65 in IEC 60050-393:2003.
