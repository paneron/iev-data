data:
  definition: of an electroacoustic transducer for sound reception, at a specified
    location, for a specified frequency, quotient of the root-mean-square open-circuit
    output voltage due to sound waves arriving more or less simultaneously with equal
    probability from all directions, by the root-meansquare sound pressure at that
    location due to the same sound waves but in the absence of the electroacoustic
    transducer
