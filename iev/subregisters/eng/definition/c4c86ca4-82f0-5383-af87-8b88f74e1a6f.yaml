  definition: quotient of the radiant flux of the radiation emitted by a <a href="IEV845-24-040">photoluminescent
    material</a> and the radiant flux of the radiation absorbed by that material
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "photoluminescence radiant yield" is also used for the elementary process
    with a similar meaning, namely the quotient of the energy of the emitted photon
    and the energy of the absorbed photon which gave rise to it.
  - The photoluminescence radiant yield has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-31 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
