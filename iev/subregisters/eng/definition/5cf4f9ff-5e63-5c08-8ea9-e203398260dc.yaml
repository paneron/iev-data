  definition: the frequency of an intermodulation product
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The combination frequencies are given by the formulas: stem:[f] = p stem:[f]~1~
    + q stem:[f]~2~ + ... where p, q, ... are positive, negative or zero integers
    and stem:[f]~1~, stem:[f]~2~ ... are the frequencies of spectral components of
    the input signal or signals.'
