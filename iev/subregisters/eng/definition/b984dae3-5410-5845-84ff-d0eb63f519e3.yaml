  definition: material which exhibits fluorescence as the result of exposure to <a
    href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Fluorescent materials absorb energy from optical radiation in the shorter wavelength
    regions of the visible spectrum and/or in the ultraviolet region and re-radiate
    some of this energy at longer wavelengths, producing narrow bands of emission
    in the visible region.
