  definition: velocity with which minority carriers would have to drift to the surface
    of the semiconductor in order to account for the rate at which they tend to combine
    there and are thus lost
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The surface recombination velocity is equal to the quotient of:


    a) the number of recombinations taking place at the surface per unit time and
    area;


    b) by the excess minority carrier concentration directly below the surface.'
