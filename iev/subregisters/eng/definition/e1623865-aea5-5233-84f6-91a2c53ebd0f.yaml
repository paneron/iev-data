  definition: the ratio of the maximum amplitude of a sinusoidal input signal to the
    value corresponding to full-scale deflection of the indicating instrument, for
    which the amplitude/amplitude characteristics of the predetector circuits of a
    receiver do not depart from linearity by more than 1 dB
