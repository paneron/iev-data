  definition: semiconductor diode that exhibits a fast transition from a high-impedance
    state to a low-resistance state and vice versa, depending on the radio-frequency
    power level delivered to the diode, thus representing at microwave frequencies
    a high or a low impedance, respectively, which enables it to limit or suppress
    unwanted microwave energy
