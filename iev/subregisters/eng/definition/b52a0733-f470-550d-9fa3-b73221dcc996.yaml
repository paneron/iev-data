data:
  definition: ratio of the number of collisions in a specified time interval between
    particles resulting in the formation of ions to the total number of interactions
    during that time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The probability of ionization strongly depends on the interaction energy and on
    the collision parameters.
