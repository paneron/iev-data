  definition: regularly transmitting device used to modify the absolute flux level
    (radiant or luminous) or <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a>,
    or both, of the radiation passing through it
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A distinction is made between selective filters and non-selective filters or neutral
    filters according to whether they do or do not alter the relative spectral distribution,
    of the radiation. A selective filter that makes a significant change in the chromaticity
    of the radiation is called a colour filter; one that alters the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral
    distribution</a> but, because of metamerism, transmits radiation of nearly the
    same chromaticity as that of the incident radiation, can be called a grey filter.
