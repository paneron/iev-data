  notes:
  - The term "polar vector" is only used in place of the term "vector" to distinguish
    it from the term "axial vector".
  - Examples of polar vectors are a geometric displacement and the gradient of a scalar
    field, and examples of polar vector quantities are velocity and electric field
    strength.
