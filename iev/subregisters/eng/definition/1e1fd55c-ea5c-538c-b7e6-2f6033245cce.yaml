data:
  definition: the representation, in a given colorimetric system and as a function
    of the wavelength, of the quantities of the three primary colours needed to match
    each of the monochromatic components of wavelength in a uniform spectrum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These colorimetric functions were formerly designated the "distribution coefficients"
    and, later, the "trichromatic spectral components".
