  definition: chromaticity coordinates representing the lighting in the viewing environment,
    excluding that from the display, measured in the plane of the display
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ambient light can have a completely different quality than the light from
    the image but this ambient light will have an effect on the appearance of colour
    stimuli and so it has to be quantified along with the colour stimulus from the
    image.
