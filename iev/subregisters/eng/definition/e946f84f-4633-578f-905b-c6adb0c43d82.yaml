  definition: a voltage transformer comprising a capacitor divider unit and an electromagnetic
    unit so designed and interconnected that the secondary voltage of the electromagnetic
    unit is substantially proportional to the primary voltage, and differs in phase
    from it by an angle which is approximately zero for an appropriate direction of
    the connections
