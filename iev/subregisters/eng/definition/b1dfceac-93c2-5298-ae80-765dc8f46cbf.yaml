  definition: 'measure of dispersion equal to the sum of the squared deviations from
    the mean value divided by the number of deviations or by that number minus 1,
    depending upon the cases considered:


    (1) variance of the whole population of stem:[N] items: stem:[(1)/(N) sum_((j
    = 1))^N ( x_j - bar X )^2]


    (2) variance of the sample of stem:[n] observations: stem:[(1)/(n) sum_((j = 1))^n
    ( x_j - bar X )^2]


    (3) estimate of the variance of the population from a sample: stem:[(1)/((n -
    1)) sum_((j = 1))^n ( x_j - bar X )^2]


    where stem:[bar X] is the mean value of the items of observation stem:[x_j] considered'
