  definition: theoretical temperature which is based on a simplified representation
    of the thermal and electrical behaviour of the semiconductor device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The virtual temperature is not necessarily the highest temperature in the device.
  - 'Based on the power dissipation and the thermal resistance or impedance that corresponds
    to the mode of operation, the virtual junction temperature can be calculated from
    the formula:


    stem:[T_j = T_((case)) + (P)/((R_((th))))] or stem:[T_j = T_((amb)) + (P)/((R_((th))))]'
