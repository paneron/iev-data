  definition: ratio of the phasor representing the reflected electric current to the
    phasor representing the incident current at a port of an electric network or close
    to a discontinuity in a transmission line
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When impedances can be defined, the complex current reflection factor equals:


    stem:[(underset(_)(r))_I = ((underset(_)(Z) - underset(_)(Z) ''))/((underset(_)(Z)
    + underset(_)(Z) ''))]


    where <u>stem:[Z]</u> is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line
    ahead of the discontinuity or the impedance of the source, and <u>stem:[Z]</u>â€²
    is the impedance after the discontinuity or the load impedance seen from the junction
    between the source and the load.'
  - The term "complex current reflection factor" may be shortened by omitting the
    qualifier "complex" in an appropriate context.
