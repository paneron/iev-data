  definition: superconductor with Perovskite-type crystal structure
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Perovskite-type structure has typical compositional and structural blocks of ABO~3~,
    where A and B refer to metallic elements and O is oxygen.
  - Perovskite superconductor includes Ba (Pb~1−stem:[x]~Bi~stem:[x]~) O~3~ and (Ba~1−stem:[x]~
    M~stem:[x]~) BiO~3~ (where M = K, Rb).
