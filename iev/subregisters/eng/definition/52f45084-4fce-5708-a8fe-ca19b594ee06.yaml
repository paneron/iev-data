  definition: crystal growth in the presence of water, elevated temperatures and pressures
    by a crystal growth process believed to proceed geologically within the Earth's
    crust
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The industrial synthetic quartz growth processes utilize alkaline water solutions
    confined within autoclaves at supercritical temperatures (330 °C to 400 °C) and
    pressures (71 MPa to 203 MPa).The autoclave is divided into two chambers: the
    dissolving chamber, containing raw quartz chips at the higher temperature; the
    growing chamber, containing cut seeds at the lower temperature.'
