  definition: quotient of the integrated value of the radiant flux of all wavelengths
    emitted by fluorescence (fluorescence band) and the radiant excitation power irradiating
    the <a href="IEV845-24-041">fluorescent material</a> for a given excitation wavelength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The fluorescent radiant efficiency is a measure of the external radiant efficiency
    of the fluorescent material; the internal radiant efficiency is obtained by taking
    a quotient of the emitted radiation and the radiant excitation power that is absorbed
    by the fluorescent material.
  - In this definition, the excitation wavelength is considered to be monochromatic.
    However, in practice, the excitation radiation will have a wavelength range and
    distribution.
  - Fluorescence is understood to include both fluorescent and phosphorescent phenomena
    with time constants short enough to be ignored for the application.
  - The fluorescent radiant efficiency has unit one.
