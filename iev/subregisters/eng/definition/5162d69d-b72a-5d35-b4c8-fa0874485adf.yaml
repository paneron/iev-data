  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of the maximum possible magnitude
    stem:[F]~t max~ of the friction force between two solid bodies with zero relative
    speed in the surface of contact, to the magnitude stem:[F]~n~ of the normal force,
    thus stem:[μ]~s~ = stem:[F]~t max~ / stem:[F]~n~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The friction force is the tangential component and the normal force is the normal
    component of the contact force between two bodies at relative rest, so not yet
    sliding.
  - 2 The tangential force stem:[F]~t max~ is greater than the tangential force stem:[F]~t~
    for slow relative speed.
