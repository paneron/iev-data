  definition: circuit-theory theorem stating that the electric current in any branch
    of a passive linear electric network and the potential difference between any
    two points in such a network, resulting from the simultaneous application of a
    number of source voltages or source currents distributed in any manner whatsoever
    throughout the network, is the algebraic sum of the currents in that branch and
    the algebraic sum of the potential differences between those two points, that
    would be caused by the individual source voltages or currents acting separately
