        modification: In the definition, deletion of "special type of" and replacement
          of "metal" by "metallic". In Note 1 to entry, replacement of "metal nanoparticles"
          by "metallic particles".  In Note 2 to entry, replacement of "A plasmon
          resonance generating metallic nanostructure is" by "Plasmon-resonance-generating
          metallic nanostructures are".

  definition: photovoltaic {{device, IEV:511-01-01}} in which its optical properties
    are modified by incorporating metallic {{nanoparticles, IEV:511-01-12}} to the
    {{semiconductor, IEV:121-12-06}} layer of the device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The {{nanostructure, IEV:511-01-08}} of the metallic particles increases the {{absorption,
    IEV:705-02-07}} and {{scattering, IEV:705-04-46}} of incident light and supports
    strong localized collective electron excitations known as surface plasmons.
  - Plasmon-resonance-generating metallic nanostructures are provided on the semiconductor
    layer of the device for resonantly coupling light into the absorbing layer and
    transporting photo-induced {{charge carriers, IEV:113-06-25}} out of the absorbing
    layer, thereby improving the performance of the device.
