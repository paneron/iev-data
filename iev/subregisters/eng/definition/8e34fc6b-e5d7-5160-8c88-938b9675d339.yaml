data:
  definition: emission of optical radiation in excess of that radiation due to normal
    thermal emission resulting from the application of electrical energy
  examples: []
  notes:
  - One example is the photon emission resulting from electron-hole recombination
    in a PN junction such as in a light emitting diode.
