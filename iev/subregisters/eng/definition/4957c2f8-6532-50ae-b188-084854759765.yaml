  definition: time integral of the blue light hazard radiance, stem:[L]~B~, as integrated
    with respect to the exposure duration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which actinic action spectrum is used, as the unit
    is the same for any action spectrum.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-21-067">radiance dose</a>".
  - The blue light hazard radiance dose is expressed in joule per square metre per
    steradian (J·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
