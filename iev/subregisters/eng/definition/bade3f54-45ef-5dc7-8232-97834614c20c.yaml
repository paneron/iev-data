  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:705-01-13}} of a specific field vector of a particular
    mode within a set of {{degenerate modes, IEV:726-03-17}} in a {{waveguide, IEV:151-12-34}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The main application of the concept "degenerate mode polarization" is in relation
    to waveguides having circular or square cross-sections, where there are two independent
    modes of propagation. In these particular cases, the polarization of the mode
    may be taken as that of the {{electric field strength, IEV:121-11-18}} vector
    on an axis of symmetry of the waveguide.
