  definition: quotient of the radiance per unit emission bandpass, dstem:[λ], at a
    specified emission wavelength, stem:[λ], due to photoluminescence from the specimen
    when irradiated at a specified excitation wavelength, stem:[μ], and the radiance
    of the perfect reflecting diffuser identically irradiated and viewed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Spectral quantities with a subscript stem:[λ] in their designation indicate differential
    spectral radiometric quantities.
  - When integrated or summed over the spectral bandpass of the instrument, this quantity
    becomes the bandpass-weighted bispectral luminescent radiance factor, stem:[β]~L,~stem:[λ](stem:[μ])Δstem:[λ].
  - The complete tabular form of bispectral luminescent radiance factor and reflected
    radiance factor data is the Donaldson matrix representation of bispectral radiance
    factor, stem:[D](stem:[μ], stem:[λ]). The excitation wavelengths, stem:[μ], are
    tabulated in the vertical direction, the emission wavelengths, stem:[λ], in the
    horizontal direction, the reflected radiance factors, stem:[β]~R~(stem:[λ]), appear
    on the diagonal where the excitation and emission (detection) wavelengths are
    equal, and the array of bandpass-weighted bispectral luminescent radiance factor
    data, stem:[β]~L~stem:[,λ](stem:[μ])Δstem:[λ], appear on the off-diagonals.
  - The bispectral luminescent radiance factor is expressed in nanometre to the power
    minus one (nm^−1^).
