  notes:
  - 'For the reactants the stoichiometric numbers are the negatives of the numbers
    appearing in the equation; for the products the stoichiometric numbers are positive.
    In equation


    CH~4~ + 2 O~2~ → CO~2~ + 2 H~2~O, the stoichiometric number of CH~4~ is −1 and
    that of O~2~ is −2, that of CO~2~ is 1 and that of H~2~O is 2.'
