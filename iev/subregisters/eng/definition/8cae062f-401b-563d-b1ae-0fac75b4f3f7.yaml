  definition: sound absorption defined by the Sabine reverberation-time equation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The Sabine reverberation-time equation is:


    stem:[T = ((( 24 ln 10 ) V))/((c A)) = ((55,3))/((c A)) V]


    where:


    stem:[T] is the reverberation time, in seconds


    stem:[V] is the volume of the room, in cubic metres


    stem:[c] is the speed of sound in the air contained in the room, in metres per
    second


    stem:[A] is the sum of all Sabine absorptions in the room, in decibel metre-squared.'
  - The unit of Sabine absorption is the decibel metre-squared, sometimes known as
    the metric sabin.
