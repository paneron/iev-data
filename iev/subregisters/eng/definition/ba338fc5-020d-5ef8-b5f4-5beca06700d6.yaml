  definition: complex quantity stem:[s = sigma + j omega] associated with a quantity
    represented by stem:[a ( t ) = A_0 e^(sigma t) cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )],
    where stem:[A_0] is the initial amplitude, stem:[Ï‰] is the angular frequency,
    stem:[t] is time, and stem:[vartheta_0] is initial phase
