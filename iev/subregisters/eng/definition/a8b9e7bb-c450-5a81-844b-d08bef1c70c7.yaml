    *Figure 2 â€“ Equivalent circuit of a piezoelectric vibrator (one-port resonator)*'
  examples:
  - A one-port piezoelectric resonator (see Figure 2) consists of series elements
    stem:[L]~1~, stem:[C]~1~, stem:[R]~1~ in parallel with stem:[C]~0~, where stem:[L]~1~,
    stem:[C]~1~, stem:[R]~1~ represent the motional inductance, capacitance and resistance
    respectively and stem:[C]~0~ the shunt capacitance. The circuit of Figure 2 has
    the same impedance as a piezoelectric resonator in the neighbourhood of resonance.
