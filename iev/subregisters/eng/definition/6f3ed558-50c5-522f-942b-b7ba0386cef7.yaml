  definition: ratio of the {{RMS value, IEV:103-02-03}} of the {{fundamental component,
    IEV:103-07-19}} of an alternating quantity to the RMS value of the quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an alternating quantity stem:[x] with RMS value stem:[X_((eff))] and RMS fundamental
    component stem:[X_((1 eff))], the fundamental factor is stem:[g = X_((1 eff))
    // X_((eff))].
  - The extension to a {{reference fundamental component, IEV:103-07-20}} is given
    in {{IEV 551-20-17, IEV:551-20-17}}.
