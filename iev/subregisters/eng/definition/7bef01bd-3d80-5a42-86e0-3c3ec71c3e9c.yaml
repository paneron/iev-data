  definition: microscope that measures microscopic geometry by monitoring the {{displacement,
    IEV:113-01-29}} of a cantilever caused by the atomic force between the cantilever
    tip and the specimen while scanning the cantilever in a {{raster, IEV:531-14-20}}
    pattern
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The optical lever method is useful for monitoring the displacement of the cantilever.
    The displacement of the cantilever is measured by detecting the reflected light
    from the cantilever. There are three types of cantilever movement in the measurements:
    1) the method wherein the cantilever contacts the specimen, 2) the method that
    monitors the {{amplitude, IEV:523-03-11}} change of the vibrating cantilever with
    cyclic contact (tapping mode), 3) the method that monitors the frequency change
    of the vibrating cantilever without contact between the cantilever and the specimen.'
