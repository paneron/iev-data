  definition: detector for which the output is proportional to the input over a specified
    range, so that the responsivity of the detector is constant over that range
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A detector is usually linear only over a certain limited range of input levels.
    The range should be specified.
  - The linear range of a detector can be affected by the use of unsuitable electronic
    circuitry.
