  definition: a process in which an incident wave, meeting a surface separating two
    different media, gives rise to another wave called a reflected wave, which propagates
    away from the surface in the same medium as the incident wave and is interpretable
    by geometrical optics
  examples: []
  notes:
  - According to the degree of fulfilment of certain geometrical optics conditions,
    the reflection may be considered as a specular reflection or a diffuse reflection.
