    \ another straight line when their associated vectors are orthogonal; \n\n* a\
    \ straight line with respect to a plane when the line is perpendicular to any\
    \ line of the plane; \n\n* a plane with respect to another plane when it contains\
    \ a straight line which is perpendicular to any line of the other plane"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Usual wordings for lines are "line A is perpendicular to line B", or "lines A
