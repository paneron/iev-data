  definition: 'dimensionless measure of the degree of mismatch between two impedances
    stem:[Z]~a~ and stem:[Z]~b~ given by the expression


    stem:[| ((Z_a - Z_b))/((Z_a + Z_b)) |]


    where stem:[Z]~a~ and stem:[Z]~b~ represent respectively the input and source
    impedance or the output and load impedance'
