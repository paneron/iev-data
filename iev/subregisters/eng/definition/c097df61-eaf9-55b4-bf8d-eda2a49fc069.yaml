  definition: an asymptotic model for wavelengths approaching zero by which the propagation
    of waves, in various media and at their boundaries is determined by using the
    geometrical concept of rays and not the general theory of waves
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Polarization of waves is generally not taken into account by geometrical optics.
  - 'For geometrical optics to be applicable in practice, the following conditions
    are required:


    a) The space variations of the electrical properties of the various media must
    be small along a distance of one wavelength.


    b) The surface separating two different media must be very large and its irregularities
    very small with respect to wavelength.


    c) The grazing angle of a wave on a surface separating two different media must
    not be too small.'
