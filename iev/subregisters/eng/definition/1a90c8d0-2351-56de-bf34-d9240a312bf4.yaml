  definition: result of an exponentiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "power" is also used for an expression representing an exponentiation.
  - In the power stem:[a]^stem:[b]^, stem:[a] is the base and stem:[b] is the exponent.
    The power is expressed by the words "stem:[a] to the power stem:[b]" or simply
    "stem:[a] to stem:[b]".
  - The power with exponent 2 is the square, stem:[a^2 = a * a], the power with exponent
    3 is the cube, stem:[a^3 = a * a * a], the power with exponent âˆ’1 is the inverse,
    stem:[a^(- 1) = 1 // a], the power with exponent 1/2 is the square root, stem:[a^(1
    // 2) = sqrt(a)].
