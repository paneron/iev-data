  definition: '{{distance relay, IEV:447-01-32}}, whose characteristic, when plotted
    on a rectangular coordinate system with {{resistance, IEV:131-12-04}} as X axis
    and {{reactance, IEV:131-12-46}} as Y axis, is a circle, the circumference of
    which passes through the origin


    Note 1 to entry: Other than in the designation of relays, the term "mho" (reciprocal
    of the term "ohm") has been replaced by "siemens" (1 S = 1/Ω) as an SI unit of
    {{conductance, IEV:131-12-06}}.'
