  definition: sum of durations of all {{supply interruptions, IEV:692-07-01}} to individual
    customers during a time interval, divided by the product of the number of customers
    affected and the duration of that time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If stem:[t]~stem:[ij]~ is the duration of the stem:[i]th interruption of supply
    to customer stem:[j] during a time interval of duration stem:[T], and stem:[N]~NS~
    the number of customers affected, then the service unavailability per customer
    interrupted is given by


    stem:[U_((CI)) = ((sum_i sum_j t_((i j))))/((N_(NS) T))]'
  - Only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Service unavailability per customer interrupted can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
