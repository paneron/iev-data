  definition: a line code in which the sequence of digits in the original signal is
    divided into successive groups of digits, some of which, when encoded, may be
    represented by one of two combinations of signal elements of equal and opposite
    disparity, the specific combinations used being chosen such that the digital sum
    tends to zero whenever possible, and in which the other groups of digits, if any,
    in the original signal are represented by combinations of signal elements of zero
    disparity
