  definition: effective irradiance with the spectral irradiance, stem:[Eλ], spectrally
    weighted with the blue light hazard spectral weighting function, stem:[B](stem:[λ])
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Blue light hazard irradiance is typically of interest for small sources subtending
    less than 0,011 rad.
  - The wavelength range for the blue light hazard irradiance is specified in ICNIRP-recommendations
    as stem:[λ] = 300 nm to stem:[λ] = 700 nm.
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which actinic action spectrum is used, as the unit
    is the same for any action spectrum.
  - The blue light hazard irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
