  definition: 'quotient NC/ND of two collinear distances on the chromaticity diagram
    of the CIE 1931 or 1964 standard colorimetric systems, the first distance being
    that between the point C representing the colour stimulus considered and the point
    N representing the specified achromatic stimulus, the second distance being that
    between the point N and the point D on the spectrum locus at the dominant wavelength
    of the colour stimulus considered, leading to the following expressions:


    stem:[p_e = ((y - y_n))/((y_d - y_n))]


    and


    stem:[p_e = ((x - x_n))/((x_d - x_n))]


    where (stem:[x], stem:[y]), (stem:[x]~n~, stem:[y]~n~), (stem:[x]~d~, stem:[y]~d~)
    are the stem:[x], stem:[y] chromaticity coordinates of the points C, N and D respectively'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of purple stimuli, the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    whose chromaticity is represented by a point on the purple boundary.
  - The formulae in stem:[x] and stem:[y] are equivalent, but greater precision is
    given by the formula which has the greater value in the numerator.
  - 'The excitation purity, stem:[p]~e~, is related to the colorimetric purity, stem:[p]~c~,
    by the equation:


    stem:[p_e = ((p_c y))/((y_d))]'
  - The excitation purity has unit one.
