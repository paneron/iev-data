  definition: 'set of points of a three-dimensional point space, the position vector
    of which is a continuous function *stem:[f]* of the pairs of real numbers stem:[u]
    and stem:[v] in some region U


    stem:[r = f ( u , v )] where stem:[( u , v ) in U sube R^2]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A surface can also be generated by a family of curves dependent on one parameter
    or, in a three-dimensional space, be defined algebraically by the equation stem:[f
    ( x , y , z ) = 0].
