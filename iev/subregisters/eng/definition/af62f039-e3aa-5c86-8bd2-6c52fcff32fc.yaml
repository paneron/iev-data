  definition: 'a) of two-winding transformers (for the principal tapping):


    the active power absorbed at rated frequency when rated current is flowing through
    the line terminal(s) of one of the windings, the terminals of the other winding
    being short-circuited, and any winding fitted with tappings being connected on
    its principal tapping


    b) of multi-winding transformers, related to a certain pair of windings (for the
    principal tapping):


    the active power absorbed at rated frequency when a current flows through the
    line terminal(s) of one of the windings of the pair, corresponding to the smaller
    of the rated power values of both windings of that pair, the terminals of the
    other winding of the same pair being short-circuited, any winding of the pair
    fitted with tappings being connected on its principal tapping and the remaining
    winding(s) being open-circuited'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The load loss can also be considered for tappings other than the principal tapping.
    The reference current of two-winding transformers is, for any tapping, equal to
    the tapping current. For multi-winding transformers, the reference current or
    reference power are related to a specified loading combination.
  - The load loss is normally related to the appropriate reference temperature.
