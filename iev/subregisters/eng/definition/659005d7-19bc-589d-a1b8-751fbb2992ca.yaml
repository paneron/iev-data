  definition: mathematical model that produces transformations which are applied to
    scene- or original-referred image data to produce image data describing a pleasing
    reproduction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Preferred reproduction models are different from other reproduction models in
    that the pleasing reproduction need not be an attempt to reproduce the appearance
    of the original. In fact, what is considered pleasing can depend on viewer preferences.
    The transformations produced by a preferred reproduction model are generally dependent
    on the characteristics of the scene or original and the output medium.
