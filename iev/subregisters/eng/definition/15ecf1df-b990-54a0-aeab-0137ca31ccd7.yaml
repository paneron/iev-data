  definition: qualifies a substance which exhibits electric hysteresis
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a ferroelectric substance, neighbouring groups of atoms interact such that
    their electric dipole moments are approximately aligned in the same direction
    over certain regions; the alignment of the resultant electric dipole moments of
    the regions increases up to a certain limit when an increasing electric field
    strength is applied.
