  definition: for a body and a specified axis, scalar quantity equal to the integral
    stem:[J] = ∫~D~ stem:[R]^2^ dstem:[m] = ∫~D~ stem:[R]^2^ stem:[ρ] dstem:[V], where
    stem:[ρ] is mass density in a domain D with quasi-infinitesimal mass dstem:[m]
    and volume dstem:[V], and stem:[R] is the distance between the domain and the
    axis
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 For a material point, the moment of inertia is equal to the product of its mass
    stem:[m] and the square of its distance stem:[R] to the axis, thus stem:[J] =
    stem:[mR]^2^. For a system of particles, it is equal to the sum of their moments
    of inertia.
  - 2 In non-relativistic physics, moment of inertia is an additive quantity.
  - 3 More generally, moment of inertia can be defined for a rigid body as a tensor
    quantity stem:[vec vec J], where stem:[J]~stem:[xx]~ = −∫(stem:[y]^2^ + stem:[z]^2^)
    dstem:[m], cycl., cycl., and stem:[J]~stem:[yz]~ = −∫ stem:[yz] dstem:[m], cycl.
    cycl.
  - 4 The moment of inertia is not to be confused with the second axial moment of
    area and the second polar moment of area.
  - 5 The coherent SI unit of moment of inertia is kilogram metre squared, kg·m^2^.
