  definition: voltage across the specified output terminals of the instrument when
    the load impedance is equal to the rated source impedance, the carrier wave not
    being modulated
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of the voltage is expressed as an r.m.s. value for sinewaves and as
    a peak-to-valley value for waveforms which are intentionally non-sinusoidal.
