  definition: at a point of a line on the interface of two fluids or a fluid and a
    solid, quantity equal to the derivative of the component stem:[F] of the force,
    tangent to the surface and perpendicular to the line, with respect to curvilinear
    abscissa stem:[l], thus stem:[gamma = d F // d l]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The surface tension is equal to the work Δstem:[W] needed to expand the surface
    by an area Δstem:[A], divided by Δstem:[A], thus stem:[γ] = Δstem:[W] / Δstem:[A.]
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of surface tension is newton per metre, N/m or, equally,
    joule per square meter, J/m^2^.
