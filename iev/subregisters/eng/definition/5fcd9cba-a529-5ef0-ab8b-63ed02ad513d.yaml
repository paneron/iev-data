data:
  definition: ratio of the power delivered to the load impedance before insertion
    of the filter to the power delivered to the load impedance after insertion of
    the filter
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The insertion attenuation is generally expressed in decibels.
  - 'An example of the frequency responses of a filter is shown in Figure 11. In this
    figure, various insertion attenuation levels are shown.
