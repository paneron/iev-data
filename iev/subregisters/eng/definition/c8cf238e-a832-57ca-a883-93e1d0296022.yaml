    relationship:
      type: identical
  definition: fraction of a parallel beam of specified radiation removed by attenuation
    in passing through a thin layer of thickness Δstem:[x] of a substance divided
    by this thickness
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The attenuation coefficient is primarily energy dependent.
  - Depending on whether Δstem:[x] is expressed in terms of length, mass per unit
    area, amount of substance or atoms per unit area, stem:[μ] is called the linear,
    mass, molar, or atomic attenuation coefficient.
