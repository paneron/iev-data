  definition: of an electroacoustic transducer for sound reception, at a specified
    location, for a specified frequency, quotient of the root-mean-square open-circuit
    output voltage due to a succession of equal sound waves incident with equal probability
    from all directions, by the sound pressure at that location due to a single such
    free sound wave in the absence of the electroacoustic transducer
