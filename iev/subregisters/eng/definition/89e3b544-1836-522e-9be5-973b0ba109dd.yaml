  definition: temperature of the air or other media, in the immediate vicinity of
    the equipment or component
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This does not refer to the temperature of any process media, unless the equipment
    or component is totally immersed in the process media.
  - If {{Ex Equipment, IEV:426-01-14}} or an {{Ex Component, IEV:426-01-13}} is located
    inside or adjacent to another piece of equipment, the "ambient temperature" is
    the temperature of the air or other media surrounding the Ex Equipment or Ex Component
    and can be higher than the ambient air surrounding the complete equipment due
    to the additional heat dissipated within the complete equipment.
  - The ambient temperature referred to in the IEC 60079 series is only related to
    the explosion safety and not the performance of the Ex Equipment or Ex Component.
