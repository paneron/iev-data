  definition: force acting on a body, equal to the product of the mass stem:[m] of
    that body and the local acceleration of free fall *stem:[g]*, thus *stem:[F]*~g~ = stem:[m]*stem:[g]*
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 When the reference frame is Earth or another astronomical object, weight comprises
    not only the local gravitational force, but also the local centrifugal force due
    to the rotation of that object.
  - 2 The effect of atmospheric buoyancy is excluded in the weight.
  - 3 In common parlance, the name "weight" continues to be used when "mass" is meant,
    but this practice is deprecated.
