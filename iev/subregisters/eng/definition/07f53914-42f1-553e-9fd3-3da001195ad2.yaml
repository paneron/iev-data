  definition: microscopic {{sensor, IEV:151-13-48}} for measuring angular velocity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Rotational and vibrational gyroscopes are based on the Coriolis force. Ring laser
    gyroscopes and optical fibre gyroscopes are based on the Sagnac effect. Among
    these types of gyroscope, vibrational gyroscopes (the tuning fork- and resonant
    piece-types) are suitable for miniaturization and are being developed for miniaturized
    applications.
