  definition: '1. an assembly, obtained by frequency division multiplexing of a specified
    number of supergroups, normally 5, in adjacent positions in a frequency band of
    specified width with guard bands between supergroups


    2. a frequency band of standardized width, 1 232 kHz, in a multichannel carrier
    system and occupying one of a number of specified positions in the spectrum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A mastergroup is normally an assembly of 300 FDM telephone channels.
  - In the USA, a mastergroup is an assembly of 10 supergroups, normally 600 FDM telephone
    channels, with a bandwidth of 2 520 kHz.
  - Signals, other than those derived from an assembly of supergroups but having specified
    characteristics, may occupy the whole or a part of a frequency band normally assigned
    to a master group.
