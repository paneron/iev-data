  definition: quotient of the sum of the individual pinning forces in a superconductor
    by the volume of the superconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The pinning force density is given by *stem:[F]*~p~ = −*stem:[J]*~c~ × *stem:[B]*,
    where *stem:[J]*~c~ is the critical current density and *stem:[B]* is the magnetic
    flux density.
