  concept: ce96a25a-fd03-5500-b5bc-4f1fae077259
  definition: value of the current corresponding to the intersection between the total
    time–current characteristic of the protective device on the load side and the
    pre-arcing (for fuses) or tripping (for circuit-breakers) time–current characteristic
    of the other protective device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The selectivity-limit current is a limiting value of current:* below which, in
    the presence of two overcurrent protective devices in series, the protective device
    on the load side completes its breaking operation in time to prevent the other
    protective device from starting its operation (i.e. selectivity is ensured);*
    above which, in the presence of two overcurrent protective devices in series,
    the protective device on the load side could not complete its breaking operation
    in time to prevent the other protective device from starting its operation (i.e.
    selectivity is not ensured).
  - '{{stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] characteristics, IEV:442-05-59}} can be used instead of
    time–current characteristics.'
