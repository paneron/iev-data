  definition: one or more conduits that supply fluid to or collect it from the {{fuel
    cell, IEV:485-08-01}} or the {{fuel cell stack, IEV:485-06-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - External manifold design refers to a fuel cell stack where the gas mixtures are
    supplied from a central source to large fuel and oxidant inlets covering adjacent
    sides of the fuel cell stack and sealed with properly designed gaskets. The exhaust
    gases are collected on the opposite sides with similar systems.
  - Internal manifold design refers to a system of ducts inside the fuel cell stack
    and penetrating the {{bipolar plates, IEV:485-06-04}} that distributes the gas
    flows among the cells.
