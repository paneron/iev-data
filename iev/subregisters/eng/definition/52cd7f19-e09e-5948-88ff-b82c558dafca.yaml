data:
  definition: for two radio waves transmitted at the same frequency, with the same
    power and orthogonal polarization, the ratio at the reception point, of the power
    received from one of the waves to the power from the other wave, in the expected
    polarization of the first wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The cross polarization isolation depends both on the characteristics of the antennas
    and on the propagation medium.
