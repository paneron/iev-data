  definition: "linear time-invariant transfer element the transfer function of which\
    \ may be written as a quotient of two polynomials in stem:[s]\n\nstem:[G ( s )\
    \ = ((V ( s )))/((U ( s ))) = ((b_0 + b_1 * s + ... + b_m * s^m))/((a_0 + a_1\
    \ * s + ... + a_n * s^n))] with stem:[aj] and stem:[bj] real, stem:[an] ≠ 0, stem:[bm]\
    \ ≠ 0\n\nwhere<table>\r\n<tr>\n<td>\nstem:[ai], stem:[bi]\n</td>\n<td>are the\
    \ polynomial coefficients;</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>stem:[s]</td>\n<td>is the\
    \ complex variable of the Laplace transform;</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>\nstem:[U](stem:[s])</td>\n\
    <td>is the input transform;</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>\nstem:[V](stem:[s])</td>\n\
    <td>is the output transform.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In real controlled systems, stem:[m] &lt; stem:[n]. With respect to mathematical
    denomination these elements would have to be called "proper-fractional rational
    transfer element" which is not usage.
  - An element with dead time is an example for a non-rational transfer element.
