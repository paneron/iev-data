  notes:
  - The term "retinal burn" is generally used to describe a thermal retinal lesion
    (see "<a href="IEV845-26-023">retinal thermal injury</a>"); however, it is sometimes
    applied to a photochemical retinal lesion. More specific terms are also used for
    a photochemical "burn", i.e. a "<a href="IEV845-26-010">photic maculopathy</a>"
    (from blue-light-induced injuries), or for a retinal thermal injury, a "chorioretinal
    thermal injury".
