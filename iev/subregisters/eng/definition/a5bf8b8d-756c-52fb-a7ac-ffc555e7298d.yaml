  definition: in a solid, energy level separating the occupied electron levels from
    the unoccupied ones at a thermodynamic temperature of zero kelvin
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In pure, undisturbed insulators and intrinsic semiconductors, the Fermi level
    is generally assigned to the centre of the forbidden band which separates the
    occupied and unoccupied levels at zero kelvin.
