data:
  definition: radiance in a given direction that results from emission at the surface
    of a photoluminescent medium under specified conditions of irradiation compared
    to the radiance in the same direction by the perfect reflecting diffuser identically
    irradiated
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The luminescent radiance factor depends upon the spectral power distribution of
    the irradiation and this quantity is typically specified for a given CIE illuminant
    condition.
  - The luminescent radiance factor has unit one.
