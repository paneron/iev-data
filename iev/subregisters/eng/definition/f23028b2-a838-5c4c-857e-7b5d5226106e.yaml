  examples: []
  notes:
  - The complex number represented by the pair (stem:[a], stem:[b]) can also be represented
    by stem:[a + j b].
  - The imaginary unit j and its opposite −j are the two square roots of −1.
  - In electrotechnology, the symbol j is preferred to the symbol i, usual in mathematics
    and other fields.
