  definition: of an electron in a gyromagnetic substance, the quotient of the magnetic
    area moment due to spin by the angular moment of the spin
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The angular precessional frequency stem:[ω] of an electron is related to the
    applied magnetic field stem:[H] by the expression: stem:[ω] = stem:[γ μ]~0~ stem:[H]


    where stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant and stem:[γ] is the gyromagnetic coefficient.'
  - 'For a free electron the gyromagnetic coefficient approximately equals: 176 × 10^9^ C kg^−1^.'
