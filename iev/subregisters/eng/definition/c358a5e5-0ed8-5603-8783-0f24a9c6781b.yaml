  definition: process by which a {{radio transmitter, IEV:713-08-01}} produces {{radio-frequency,
    IEV:702-01-10}} {{energy, IEV:113-03-45}} for the purpose of {{radiocommunication,
    IEV:701-01-31}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In radiocommunication, the term “emission” should not be used in the more general
    sense of radio-frequency {{emission, IEV:702-02-03}}. For example, the production
    of the part of {{electromagnetic energy, IEV:121-11-64}} from the {{local oscillator,
    IEV:713-10-06}} that is transferred to external space, is a {{radiation, IEV:702-02-06}}
    and not an emission.
  - The term “emission” is also used for the radio waves or signals produced (see
    {{IEV 161-01-09, IEV:161-01-09}}), for the production of any waves or particles
    (see {{IEV 702-02-03, IEV:702-02-03}}), as a synonym for a {{programme, IEV:723-01-02}}
    in broadcasting and for {{transmission, IEV:723-01-03}} in broadcasting, and for
    a release into the environment (see {{IEV 904-01-11, IEV:904-01-11}}).
  - In French, the term “{{émission, IEV:702-02-04}}” is also used for the concept
    represented by the English term “{{sending, IEV:702-02-04}}” of a signal.
