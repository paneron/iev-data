  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the magnetic field
    strength *stem:[H]* is equal to the magnetization *stem:[M]*


    *stem:[M]* = stem:[κ]*stem:[H]*'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In an isotropic medium the magnetic susceptibility is a scalar, and in an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
  - In some literature, the symbol stem:[χ]~m~ (rather than stem:[κ]) is used for
    the "magnetic susceptibility".
