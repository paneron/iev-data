  definition: 'function expressing the probability stem:[P](stem:[E]), for a particle
    obeying Fermi statistics, that it will occupy a permitted energy level stem:[E]


    stem:[P ( E ) = (1)/((1 + exp ( ((E - E_F))/((k T)) )))]


    where


    stem:[k] is the Boltzmann constant


    stem:[T] is the thermodynamic temperature


    stem:[E]~F~ is the Fermi-level


    and where this level is quantized and may contain 0, 1 or 2 electrons.'
