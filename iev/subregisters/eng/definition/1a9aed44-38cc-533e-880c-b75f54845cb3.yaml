  definition: thin layer of superconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Superconducting thin film: superconductor film of average thickness less than
    some typical value, assumed conventionally 1 μm, that is typically obtained by
    PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition), CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) or other techniques.'
  - 'Superconducting thick film: superconductor film of average thickness of more
    than some typical value, assumed conventionally between 1 μm to 10 μm, that is
    typically obtained by screen printing, or doctor-blade or dip coating methods.'
