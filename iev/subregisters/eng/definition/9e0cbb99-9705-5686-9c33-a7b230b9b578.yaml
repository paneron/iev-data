  definition: representation of a sinusoidal integral quantity by a complex quantity
    whose argument is equal to the initial phase and whose modulus is equal to the
    root-mean-square value ({{103-02-03, IEV:103-02-03}})
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a quantity stem:[a ( t ) = A sqrt(2) cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )] the phasor
    is stem:[A exp j vartheta_0]. Electric current phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)] and
    voltage phasor stem:[underset(_)(U)] are often used.
  - The similar representation with the modulus equal to the amplitude is sometimes
    also called "phasor". See {{103-07-14, IEV:103-07-14}}.
  - A phasor can also be represented graphically.
