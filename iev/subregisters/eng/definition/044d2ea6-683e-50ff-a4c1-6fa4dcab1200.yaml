  definition: change in effect on an object's behaviour or properties caused by a
    change in one or more of the object's dimensions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The volume of an object is proportional to the third power of its length dimensions,
    while the surface area is proportional to the second power. As a result, the effect
    of surface force becomes larger than that of the body force in the microscopic
    world. For example, the dominant force in the motion of a microscopic object is
    not the inertial force, but the electrostatic force or viscous force. Material
    properties of microscopic objects are also affected by the internal material structure
    and surface, and, as a result, characteristic values are sometimes different from
    those of bulks. Frictional properties in the microscopic world also differ from
    those in the macroscopic world. Therefore, those effects must be considered carefully
    while designing a {{micromachine, IEV:523-01-03}}.
