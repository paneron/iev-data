  definition: method to evaluate superconducting transport properties by measuring
    the change in resistance as a function of temperature, current or applied magnetic
    field strength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For the elimination of contact potentials and contact resistance, a current four-wire
    method, employing two potential leads and two current leads, is preferred.
