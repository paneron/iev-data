  definition: colourfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of
    a similarly illuminated area that appears grey, white or highly transmitting
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For given viewing conditions and at luminance levels within the range of photopic
    vision, a colour stimulus perceived as a related colour, of a given chromaticity
    and from a surface that has a given luminance factor, exhibits approximately constant
    chroma for all levels of illuminance except when the brightness is very high.
    In the case of unrelated colours, at a given level of illuminance, if the luminance
    factor is increased, the chroma usually increases.
