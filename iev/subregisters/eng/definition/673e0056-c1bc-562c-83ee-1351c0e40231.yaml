  definition: the maximum possible justification rate that can be accommodated by
    the justification process
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, the tolerance limits on the digit rates of the original digital signal
    and the channel provided for conveying it by justification should be such that
    the justification rate is always less than the justification capacity.
  - Because of the confusion which arises in English from the similarity of the terms
    "maximum justification rate " and "maximum justification ratio", it is strongly
    recommended that "justification capacity" should be used instead of the first
    of those terms.
