  definition: the magnetization curve obtained when a material, initially in a neutral
    magnetic state, is subjected to a magnetic field, the strength of which increases
    monotonically from zero

  notes:
  - The method of obtaining the neutral magnetic state should be thermal or dynamic
    ; the method used should be stated.
