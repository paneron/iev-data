  definition: 'approximate form of Planck''s law, valid with an approximation better
    than one part in 1 000 when the product stem:[λT] is smaller than 0,002 m·K


    stem:[L_((e , lambda)) ( lambda , T ) = ((c_1))/(pi) lambda^(- 5) e^(((c_2))/((lambda
    T)))]


    where stem:[L]~e,~stem:[λ] is spectral radiance, stem:[λ] is the wavelength in
    vacuum, stem:[T] is thermodynamic temperature, stem:[c_1 \ = 2 \ pi \ h \ c_0^2],
    stem:[c_2 \ = h \ c_0 \ // \ k], stem:[h] is the Planck constant, stem:[c]~0~
    is the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}, and stem:[k] is the Boltzmann
    constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The formula is sometimes written with stem:[((c_1))/((pi omega_0))] instead of
    stem:[((c_1))/(pi)], where stem:[Ω]~0~ is the solid angle of magnitude 1 sr.
  - For a detector in a medium of refractive index stem:[n], the measured radiance
    is stem:[n]^−2^stem:[L]~e,~stem:[λ](stem:[λ], stem:[T]).
  - Wien's law can also be expressed to give the approximate <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral
    distribution</a> of radiant exitance stem:[M]~e,~stem:[λ](stem:[λ], stem:[T]);
    the first factor in the formula is then stem:[c]~1~ instead of stem:[((c_1))/(pi)].
  - The quantities radiance (as referred to in Note 2 to entry) and radiant exitance
    (as referred to in Note  3 to entry) apply to the <a href="IEV845-21-021">unpolarized
    radiation</a> as emitted.
