data:
  definition: method to determine AC loss by exposing a sample to an AC field or by
    applying an alternating current and measuring the heat generated within the sample
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of superconducting materials, the sample is usually immersed in cryogenic
    liquid and the amount of liquid evaporated is used to calculate the heat input.
