data:
  definition: for a polyphase line consisting of stem:[m] line conductors and one
    neutral conductor, sum of the stem:[m] instantaneous powers expressed for each
    line conductor by the product of the polyphase line-to-neutral voltage and the
    corresponding line current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If there is no neutral conductor, the voltages between the line conductors and
    any reference point have to be used instead of the polyphase line-to-neutral voltages.
