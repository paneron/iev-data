data:
  definition: the loss, expressed in decibels, constant at all frequencies transmitted,
    which has to be introduced into the new fundamental system for the determination
    of reference equivalents or NOSFER in order to obtain in a given direction the
    same loudness as the complete telephone connection being considered, the acoustical
    speech power emitted by the talker being the same in both cases
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reference equivalent is positive or negative according to whether it has been
    necessary for a loss to be added or removed from the NOSFER.
  - The reference equivalent is strictly defined by the measuring method described
    in the CCITT Recommendations P42 and P72 from the Volume V of the Red Book, 1985.
