  definition: 'distribution, defined as the limit of a positive function, equal to
    zero outside a small interval containing the origin, the integral of which remains
    equal to one when this interval tends to zero


    stem:[delta ( t ) = { [[0],[oo],[0]] [[ for t 0],[ for t = 0],[ for t &gt; 0]]
    with int_((- oo))^((+ oo)) delta ( t ) d t = 1]


    SEE: Figure 4a) and IEC 60027-6.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'A distribution assigns a number to any function stem:[f](stem:[t]), sufficiently
    smooth for stem:[t] = stem:[t]~0~ [see CEI 60050-103:2009, 103-03-05].


    The Dirac impulse does this according to


    stem:[f ( t_0 ) = int_((- oo))^(oo) delta ( t - t_0 ) f ( t ) d t].'
  - 'Any shape with area 1 may be used for the definition of δ(stem:[t]), e.g. a rectangular
    pulse with width stem:[τ] and height stem:[τ]^–1^, or a triangular pulse, as shown
    in Figure 4a), as well as a Gaussian function


    stem:[(1)/((tau * sqrt(pi))) * e^(- ((t^2))/((tau^2)))].'
  - Any of the shapes mentioned in Note 2 to entry with stem:[τ] much smaller than
    the smallest time constant at work in the system under consideration may be used
    for a technical approximation of the Dirac impulse.
  - In control technology the Dirac function is mainly important for the definition
    of impulses and exclusively used as a function of time. Therefore the term Dirac
    impulse is used and the definition is adapted accordingly.
