      original: IEC 62047-1:2016, 2.1.1, modified â€“ The preferred term "micro-electromechanical
        device" has been replaced by "micro-electromechanical system" to reflect current
        usage. Note 1 to entry has been revised for clarity, and the second sentence
        has been transferred to Note 2 to entry.

  definition: '{{system, IEV:151-11-27}} composed of one or more integrated microsized
    {{components, IEV:151-11-21}}, such as {{sensors, IEV:151-13-48}}, {{actuators,
    IEV:151-13-49}}, {{transducers, IEV:151-13-34}}, resonators, {{oscillators, IEV:151-13-51}},
    mechanical components, or {{electric circuits, IEV:131-11-07}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the definition,  "microsized" is used to mean a size of less than a few millimetres.
  - Technologies relating to MEMS are extremely diverse and include fundamental technologies
    (such as design, material, processing, functional element, system control, energy
    supply, {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} and assembly, electric circuit, and evaluation),
    basic sciences (such as micro-science and engineering) as well as thermodynamics
    on a micro-scale and {{microtribology, IEV:523-02-02}}.
  - '"MEMS" is the acronym of "micro-electromechanical systems", but was used in the
    past for "micro-electromechanical device". The singular and plural forms of the
    term "MEMS" are identical.'
