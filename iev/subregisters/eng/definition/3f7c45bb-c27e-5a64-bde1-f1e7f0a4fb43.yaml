  definition: control by a device designed to operate in a different manner on the
    positive and negative half cycles of an alternating voltage or current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Generalized phase control is asymmetrical if the current waveform is not the same
    for both positive and negative half cycles.
  - Multicycle control is asymmetrical if within each conduction period the number
    of positive and negative half cycles is unequal.
