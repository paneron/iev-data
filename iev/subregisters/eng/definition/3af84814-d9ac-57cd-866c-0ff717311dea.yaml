  definition: a measure of the extent to which radiation can be considered to be coherent
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The magnitude of the degree of coherence is equal to the visibility, V, of the
    fringes of a 2-beam interference experiment:


    stem:[V = ((S_((max)) - S_((min))))/((S_((max)) + S_((min))))]


    where stem:[S]~max~ is the irradiance at a maximum of the interference pattern,
    and stem:[S]~min~ is the irradiance at a minimum.'
  - Optical radiation is considered highly coherent when the degree of coherence exceeds
    0.88, partially coherent for values less than 0.88 and incoherent for values significantly
    less than 0.88.
