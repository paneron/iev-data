data:
  definition: reduction in the brightness of a predominantly long-wavelength colour
    stimulus relative to that of a predominantly short-wavelength colour stimulus,
    when the luminances are reduced in the same proportion from photopic to mesopic
    or scotopic levels, without changing the respective relative spectral distributions
    of the stimuli involved
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In passing from photopic vision to mesopic vision or scotopic vision, the spectral
    luminous efficiencies change, the wavelength of maximum efficiency being displaced
    towards the shorter wavelengths.
