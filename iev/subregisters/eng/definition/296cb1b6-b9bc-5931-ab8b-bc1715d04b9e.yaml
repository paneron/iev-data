data:
  definition: fundamental physical constant such that the gravitational force stem:[F]
    between two particles with masses stem:[m]~1~ and stem:[m]~2~ at a distance stem:[r]
    is given by stem:[F = G ((m_1 m_2))/((r^2))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of the gravitational constant is 6,674 28(67) × 10^−11^ m^3^ ⋅ kg^−1^
    ⋅ s^−2^ (CODATA 2006).
