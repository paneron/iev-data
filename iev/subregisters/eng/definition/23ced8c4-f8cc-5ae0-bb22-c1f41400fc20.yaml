  concept: 808d52f2-7c05-5aa0-a75a-18769d9e0c7a
  definition: phenomenon in which a moving structure is stuck to another structure
    or {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}} by adhesion forces
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When structures become smaller, stiction appears significant owing to the {{scale
    effect, IEV:523-02-01}}, meaning that surface forces predominate over body forces.
    Stiction frequently occurs in the MEMS fabrication process when small structures
    are released during wet etching processes owing to the {{surface tension, IEV:113-03-42}}
    of liquid. Representative adhesion forces that cause stiction are van der Waals
    force, electrostatic force, and surface tension of liquid between structures.
