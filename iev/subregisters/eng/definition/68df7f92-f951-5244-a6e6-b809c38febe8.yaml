  definition: supplements a {{quantity name, IEV:112-01-02}} for a quantity expressing
    a flux or a current within three-dimensional space to indicate the quotient of
    such a quantity by the area of a surface
  examples:
  - '{{density of heat flow rate, IEV:113-04-37}} or areic heat flow rate, electric
    current density (see {{IEV 121-11-11, IEV:121-11-11}}), {{magnetic flux density,
    IEV:121-11-19}}.'
  notes:
  - In English, "density" also, and more commonly, means specific mass. In French,
    the term "densit√©" means relative mass density (or relative density).
