  definition: '. function stem:[f ( t )] which is a measure of the similarity of two
    deterministic functions stem:[f_1 ( t )] and stem:[f_2 ( t )], defined by


    stem:[f ( t ) = int_( - oo)^( + oo) f_1 ( tau ) f_2 ( t + tau ) d tau]

    .  function stem:[f ( t )] which is a measure of the similarity of two stationary
    random functions stem:[f_1 ( t )] and stem:[f_2 ( t )], defined by

  notes:
  - 'The Fourier transform of stem:[f ( t )] is equal to the product of the conjugate
    of the Fourier transform of stem:[f_1 ( t )] and the Fourier transform of stem:[f_2
    ( t )]:


    stem:[F ( omega ) = F_1^( ** ) ( omega ) F_2 ( omega )]'
