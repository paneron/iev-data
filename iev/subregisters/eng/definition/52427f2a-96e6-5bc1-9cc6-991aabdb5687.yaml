data:
  definition: area on the Earth's surface, associated with a space station, within
    which, under specified technical conditions, it is feasible for radiocommunication
    facilities of a specified nature to be established with one or more earth stations
    which are transmitting, receiving or both transmitting and receiving
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Several coverage areas may be associated with the same space station, for example,
    a satellite with several antenna beams.
  - In the absence of interference the coverage area will be bounded by a contour
    of pre-determined power flux density.
  - The concept of coverage area, as defined here, applies in a simple way only to
    space stations on board satellites which are geostationary.
