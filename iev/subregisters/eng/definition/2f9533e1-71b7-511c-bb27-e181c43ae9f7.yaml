  definition: conversion of radiant energy to energy in chemical bonds
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Photosynthesis in plants is well known and involves assimilation of carbon dioxide
    into simple sugars. The energy from sunlight or artificial light (principally
    in the wavelength range 400 nm to 700 nm), is converted into chemical bond energy
    in the sugars. Photosynthesis in the skin occurs when 7‑dehydrocholesterol in
    the skin absorbs UV-B solar radiation and is converted to previtamin D3.
