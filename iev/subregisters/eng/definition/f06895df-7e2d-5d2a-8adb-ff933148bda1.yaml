data:
  definition: the ratio of the transverse component of the electric field strength
    vector to that of the magnetic field strength vector at a point in a specified
    transverse cross-section of a transmission line
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a uniform transmission line with homogeneous transverse cross-section the characteristic
    wave impedance is the same at every point.
