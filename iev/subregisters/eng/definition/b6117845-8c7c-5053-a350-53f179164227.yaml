  definition: colour television system in which the baseband colour video signal is
    obtained by time multiplexing, during the period of one scanning line, the various
    components, generally the luminance signal and one or two chrominance components,
    the components having previously been subject to analogue temporal compression
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Currently, the resultant MAC picture signal is broadcast in analogue form.
  - In most MAC systems, any associated sound channels are time multiplexed with the
    components of the colour video signal.
  - MAC is an abbreviation of "Multiplexed Analogue Components".
