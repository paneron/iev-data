  definition: quantitative or qualitative method of analysis that involves failure
    modes and effects analysis together with a consideration of the probability of
    the failure mode occurrence and the severity of the effects
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "fault mode, effects and criticality analysis" in IEC 60050-191:1990
    (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015) is deprecated, since a fault ({{192-04-01,
    IEV:192-04-01}}) is a state and cannot logically have a mode, whereas a failure
    mode ({{192-03-17, IEV:192-03-17}}) is a change of state.
