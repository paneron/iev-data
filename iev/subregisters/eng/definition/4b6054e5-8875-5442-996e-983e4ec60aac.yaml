    tolerances

  notes:
  - In an emergency state, urgent actions (such as load shedding; reducing voltage;
    and starting emergency generators) are required to prevent equipment damage and/or
    further degradation of system state.
  - Although {{loss of load, IEV:692-01-16}} can occur, it is not a criterion for
    an emergency state.
