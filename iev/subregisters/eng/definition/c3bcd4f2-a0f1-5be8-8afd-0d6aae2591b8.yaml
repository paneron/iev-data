  definition: 'the fractional change of inductance due to a change in temperature
    divided by that change in temperature:


    stem:[alpha_L = ((L_(theta) - L_((ref))))/((L_((ref)) ( theta - theta_((ref))
    )))]


    where stem:[Lθ] and stem:[L]~ref~ are the inductances at temperatures stem:[θ]
    and stem:[θ]~ref~ respectively'
