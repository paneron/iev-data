  definition: the value of the magnetic flux density remaining in a magnetized body
    when, in the absence of a self-demagnetizing field, the applied magnetic field
    strength is brought to zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the initial state is one of magnetic saturation, the remanent flux density
    is termed "magnetic remanence".
