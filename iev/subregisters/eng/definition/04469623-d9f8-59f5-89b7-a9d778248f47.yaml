  definition: a positive-particle accelerator in which the particles travel in a succession
    of semi-circular orbits of increasing radii under the influence of a magnetic
    field which is constant in time and are accelerated at the beginning of each such
    orbit by traversing an electric field produced by a high-frequency generator
