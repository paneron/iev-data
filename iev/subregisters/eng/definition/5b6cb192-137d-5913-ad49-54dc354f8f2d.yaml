  definition: expression of the dependence of a quantity on the {{base quantities,
    IEV:112-01-08}} of a system of quantities as a product of powers of factors corresponding
    to the base quantities, omitting any numerical factor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A power of a factor is the factor raised to an exponent. Each factor is the dimension
    of a base quantity.
  - The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is
    a single upper case letter in roman (upright) sans-serif type. The conventional
    symbolic representation of the dimension of a derived quantity is the product
    of powers of the dimensions of the base quantities according to the definition
    of the derived quantity. The dimension of a quantity stem:[Q] is denoted by dim
    stem:[Q].
  - In deriving the dimension of a quantity, no account is taken of its scalar, vector
    or tensor character.
  - "In a given system of quantities,\r\n\r\n* quantities of the same kind (see {{IEV\
    \ 112-01-04, IEV:112-01-04}}) have the same dimension,\r\n* quantities of different\
    \ dimensions are always of different kinds, and\r\n* quantities having the same\
    \ dimension are not necessarily of the same kind. For example, in the {{International\
    \ System of Quantities, IEV:112-02-01}} (ISQ), pressure and energy density (volumic\
    \ energy) have the same dimension L^–1^MT^–2^. See also note 5.\r\n"
  - "In the International System of Quantities (ISQ), the symbols representing the\
    \ dimensions of the base quantities are:\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"\

    \nThus, the dimension of a quantity stem:[Q] is denoted by dim stem:[Q] = `L`stem:[α]`M`stem:[β]`T`stem:[γ]`I`stem:[δ]`Θ`stem:[ε]`N`stem:[ζ]`J`stem:[η],\
    \ where the exponents, named dimensional exponents, are positive, negative, or\
    \ zero. Factors with exponent 0 are usually omitted. When all exponents are zero,\
    \ the symbol `1`, printed in sans-serif type, is used to represent the dimension.\
    \ Examples are:\r\n\r\n* The dimension of force is dim stem:[F] = LMT^–2^.\r\n\
    * Mass concentration of a given component and mass density (volumic mass) have\
    \ the same dimension ML^–3^.\r\n* Electric current and scalar magnetic potential\
    \ have the same dimension I^1^ = I, although they are not quantities of the same\
    \ kind.\r\n"
  - 'An exponent can be fractional.


    The period stem:[T] of a pendulum of length stem:[l] at a place with the local
    acceleration of free fall stem:[g] is:


    stem:[T = 2 pi sqrt((1)/(g))] or stem:[T = C ( g ) sqrt(l)] where


    stem:[C ( g ) = ((2 pi))/((sqrt(g)))]


    Hence dim stem:[C](stem:[g]) = `T`· `L`^−1/2^.'
