  definition: disappearance of the supply voltage for a time interval whose duration
    is between two specified limits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, a reduction of the supply voltage to less than 5 % or 10 % of the
    nominal voltage is considered to be a short interruption, with the lower limit
    of the duration typically a few tenths of a second and its upper limit typically
    in the order of one minute (or in some cases up to three or five minutes).
