data:
  definition: wave which can be represented by a sinusoidal field quantity with phase
    stem:[omega t - k * r + vartheta_0] where *stem:[k]* is a vector characteristic
    of the wave, *stem:[r]* is position vector, stem:[ω] is angular frequency, stem:[t]
    is time, and stem:[vartheta_0] is initial phase
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Vector *stem:[k]* is called “{{wave vector, IEV:103-10-09}}”.
