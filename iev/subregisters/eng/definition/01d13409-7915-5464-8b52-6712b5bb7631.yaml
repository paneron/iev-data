  definition: "unique positive value, if it exists, associated with a subset of a\
    \ surface in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, with the following properties:\n\
    \n\n\n* for a rectangle, the value is the product of the two side lengths, \n\n\
    * for a disjoint union of subsets, the value is the sum of the values associated\
    \ with these subsets, \n\n* for more complicated subsets, the value can be approximated\
    \ by sums and given by an integral"

  notes:
  - For the portion of plane limited by the straight lines stem:[x] = stem:[a], stem:[x]
    = stem:[b], stem:[y] = 0 and the arc of curve stem:[y = f](stem:[x]) with stem:[a]
    &lt; stem:[b] and stem:[f](stem:[x]) ≥ 0, the area is stem:[int_a^b f ( x ) d
    x].
  - For a surface defined by stem:[r = f ( u , v )] where stem:[( u , v ) in U sube
    R^2], the area is stem:[underset(U)( ∬ ) | ((del f))/((del u)) * ((del f))/((del
    u)) | * d u d v].
  - For a surface defined by the equation stem:[z] = stem:[f](stem:[x, y]), the area
    is stem:[underset(S)( ∬ ) sqrt(1 + ( ((del f))/((del x)) )^2 + ( ((del f))/((del
    y)) )^2) d x d y].
  - In the usual geometrical space, the area of a surface is a quantity of the dimension
    length squared.
