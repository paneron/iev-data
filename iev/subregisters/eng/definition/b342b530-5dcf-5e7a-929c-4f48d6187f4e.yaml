  definition: 'density of radiant flux with respect to solid angle in a specified
    direction


    stem:[I_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d omega))]


    where stem:[Φ]~e~ is the radiant flux emitted in a specified direction, and stem:[Ω]
    is the solid angle containing that direction'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition holds strictly only for a <a href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>.
  - 'The distribution of the radiant intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]), is used to determine
    the radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~e~, within a certain solid angle, stem:[Ω], of a source:


    stem:[Phi_e = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_e ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta d phi \
    d vartheta].'
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous intensity". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon intensity".
  - The radiant intensity is expressed in watt per steradian (W·sr^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-30 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
