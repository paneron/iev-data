data:
  definition: angle between a defined datum axis related to the luminaire and the
    horizontal when the luminaire is mounted for photometric measurement
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The defined datum axis can be any feature of the luminaire, but it will usually
    relate to a feature that is nominally aligned with the horizontal such as an axis
    through the luminous opening or an axis through an array of LEDs or a fixing spigot
    entry axis.
  - The tilt during measurement is expressed in radian (rad) or degree (Â°).
