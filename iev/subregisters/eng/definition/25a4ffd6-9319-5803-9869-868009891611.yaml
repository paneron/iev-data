  definition: '{{nano-object, IEV:511-01-07}} with all three external dimensions in
    the {{nanoscale, IEV:511-01-03}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the lengths of the longest to the shortest axes of the nano-object differ significantly
    (typically by more than three times), the terms {{nanofibre, IEV:511-01-10}} or
    {{nanoplate, IEV:511-01-11}} should be used instead of the term nanoparticle.
