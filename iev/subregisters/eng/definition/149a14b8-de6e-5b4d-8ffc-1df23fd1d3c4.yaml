  definition: 'identity resulting from the divergence theorem applied to the vector
    field stem:[f_1 grad f_2 - f_2 grad f_1], where stem:[f]~1~ and stem:[f]~2~ are
    two scalar fields given at each point of a three-dimensional domain V limited
    by a closed surface S


    * *stem:[underset(V)( ∭ ) ( f_1 Delta f_2 - f_2 Delta f_1 ) d V = underset(S)(
    ∯ ) ( f_1 grad f_2 - f_2 grad f_1 ) * e_n d A]


    where dstem:[V] is the volume element, *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface
    element and Δ is the Laplacian operator'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The second Green formula is symmetric with respect to stem:[f]~1~ and stem:[f]~2~.
