data:
  definition: loss of the type whose value is proportional to the frequency of a time-varying
    magnetic field arising in a superconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Hysteresis loss is caused by the irreversible magnetic properties of the superconducting
    material due to pinning of flux lines.
