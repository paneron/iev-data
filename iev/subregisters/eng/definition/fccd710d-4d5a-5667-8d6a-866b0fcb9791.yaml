  definition: 'disintegrations per unit time dstem:[N]/dstem:[t] for an {{atomic nucleus,
    IEV:113-05-21}} divided by the number of nuclei stem:[N] existing at the same
    time stem:[t]


    stem:[lambda = - (1)/(N) xx ((d N))/((d t))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The decay constant is expressed in reciprocal seconds (s^âˆ’1^).
  - The decay constant may be considered the total probability of radioactive decay
    (disintegration and/or nuclear transition).
  - This entry was numbered 393-14-18 in IEC 60050-393:2003.
