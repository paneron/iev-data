  definition: '1. an assembly, obtained by frequency division multiplexing, of a specified
    number of mastergroups, normally 3, in adjacent positions in a frequency band
    of specified width with guard bands between adjacent mastergroups


    2. a frequency band of standardized width, 3 872 kHz, in a multichannel carrier
    system and occupying one of a number of specified positions in the spectrum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A supermastergroup is normally an assembly of 900 FDM telephone channels.
  - Signals, other than those derived from an assembly of mastergroups but having
    specified characteristics, may occupy the whole or a part of a frequency band
    normally assigned to a supermastergroup.
