  definition: law stating that the total radiant exposure required to elicit a given
    photobiological or photochemical response is independent of the duration over
    which the exposure occurs
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Bunsenâ€“Roscoe law generally holds only over a given limited range of exposure
    durations. Reciprocity failure can occur due to repair mechanisms, recombination
    effects over long periods, or photon saturation for extremely short periods.
