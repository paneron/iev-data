  definition: unit inserted between the power supply and at least one discharge lamp
    that, by means of inductance, capacitance or resistance, single or in combination,
    serves mainly to limit the current of the discharge lamp(s) to the required value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A ballast can also include means for transforming from the power supply voltage
    and arrangements which help to provide starting voltage and preheating current,
    to prevent cold starting, to reduce stroboscopic effect, to correct the power
    factor and to suppress radio interference.
