  definition: vector quantity equal to the product of the mass stem:[m] of a body
    and the velocity *stem:[v]* of its centre of mass, thus *stem:[p]* = stem:[mv]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 For a continuous body in a domain D, momentum is equal to the integral stem:[p
    = int_D rho v d V = int_D v d m], where stem:[ρ] is the mass density in a domain
    having quasi-infinitesimal volume dstem:[V] and mass dstem:[m], and velocity *stem:[v]*.
    For a system of bodies, it is equal to the sum of their momentums.
  - 2 If the sum of external forces is equal to zero, momentum of a body follows a
    law of conservation.
  - 3 If the theory of relativity is applied, stem:[m] is relativistic mass.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second, kg·m·s^−1^.
