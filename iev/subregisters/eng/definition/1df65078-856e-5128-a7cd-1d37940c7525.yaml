  definition: 'between two terminals A and B, quantity stem:[u]~AB~ equal to the difference
    of the electric potentials stem:[v]~A~  at A and stem:[v]~B~ at B:


    stem:[u]~AB~ = stem:[v]~A~ â€“ stem:[v]~B~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In circuit theory, the electric field is assumed to be irrotational. Therefore,
    the definition is consistent with the definition given in electromagnetism for
    a more general case [121-11-27].
