  definition: maximum value of <a href="IEV845-21-091">spectral luminous efficacy</a>
    for a specified photometric condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic).
    If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the symbol stem:[K]~m~
    is used. For other photometric conditions, the respective symbol for identification
    shall be used.
  - 'The value of maximum luminous efficacy for photopic vision is calculated by


    stem:[K_m = ((683))/((V ( lambda_((cd)) ))) cd * sr * W^(- 1) tildetilde 683 \
    lm * W^(- 1)]


    where stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is the <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>
    for photopic vision and stem:[λ]~cd~ is the wavelength in air corresponding to
    the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} 540 × 10^12^ Hz specified in the definition of
    the SI unit candela.'
  - The maximum luminous efficacy is expressed in lumen per watt (lm·W^−1^).
