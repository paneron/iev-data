  definition: a sound pressure level in decibels, obtained by adding to perceived
    noise level an adjustment that is related to the degree of irregularity that may
    occur among contiguous one-third-octave band sound pressure levels of an aircraft
    noise
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The adjustment is described in ISO 3891-1978 ; it may vary from 0 dB to 6,7 dB.
  - The adjustment purports to account for the extra subjective noisiness caused by
    pronounced audible tones such as may be generated by propellors, compressors,
    turbines or fans.
