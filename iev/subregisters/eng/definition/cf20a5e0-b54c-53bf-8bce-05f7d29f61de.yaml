  definition: the distribution as a function of frequency of the power per unit bandwidth
    of the spectral components of a signal or a noise having a continuous spectrum
    and a finite mean power
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The instantaneous power of a signal or a noise is by convention equal to the square
    of its instantaneous value. This square is proportional to a physical power if
    the characteristic quantity is a field quantity.
  - The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function
    of the signal or noise. The autocorrelation function of a deterministic signal
    exists if the signal has a finite mean power. The autocorrelation function of
    a random signal or random noise exists if it is represented by a second order
    random stationary function.
