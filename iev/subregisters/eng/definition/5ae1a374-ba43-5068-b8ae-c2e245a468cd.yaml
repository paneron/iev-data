  definition: 'for a capacitive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, derivative
    of the electric charge stem:[q] with respect to the voltage stem:[u]~AB~ ({{131-11-56,
    IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals:

    where the sign of the electric charge is determined by taking the current in the
    time integral defining the electric charge as positive if its direction is from
    A to B and negative in the opposite case'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an ideal capacitor, the differential capacitance stem:[C]~d~ is equal to its
    capacitance stem:[C].
