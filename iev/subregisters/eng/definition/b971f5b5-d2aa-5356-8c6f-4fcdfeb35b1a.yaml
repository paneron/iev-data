    significant instant from the corresponding ideal instant, to a specified unit
    interval

  - Ву convention the displacement is considered positive when the significant instant
    occurs after the ideal instant, and conversely it is considered negative when
    it occurs before.
  - The degree of individual distortion is usually expressed as a percentage.
