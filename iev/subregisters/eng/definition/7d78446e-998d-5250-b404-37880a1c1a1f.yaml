      original: IEC 80000-13:2008, 13-11, modified – Addition of information useful
        for the context of the IEV, and adaptation to the IEV rules

      relationship:
        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: 18c5e527-e08b-54a7-8aa3-0d99fde1bdf5
  definition: quotient of the number of specified {{data elements, IEV:171-02-01}}
    {{transferred, IEV:171-06-01}} in a time interval by the duration of this interval
  examples:
  - '{{Digit rate, IEV:702-05-23}}, stem:[r]~d~ or stem:[ν]~d~; transfer rate for
    bytes, stem:[r]~B~, stem:[r]~o~, stem:[ν]~B~, or stem:[ν]~o~; {{binary digit rate,
    IEV:704-16-07}} (or bit rate), stem:[r]~b~, stem:[r]~bit~, stem:[ν]~b~, or stem:[ν]~bit~.'
  notes:
  - The transfer rate is expressed in seconds to the power of minus one (s^−1^). In
    practice, it is expressed in digits per second, for example in bits per second
    (bit/s) or in bytes per second (B/s). These units can be combined with decimal
    multiple prefixes, for example kilobyte per second (kB/s).
