data:
  definition: a transmission process which may be used when the transmission channel
    rate is higher than the input binary rate. The binary digits being transferred
    are signalled at the digit rate of the channel and the transfer is interrupted
    at intervals in order to produce the required mean binary rate. The interruption
    is always for an integral number of digits periods
