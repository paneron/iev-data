  definition: quantity developed for the public domain, for weather forecasting and
    climatology, which quantifies the erythemal potential (or sunburning power) of
    the ambient solar <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet radiation</a>, but could
    also be applied to other sources
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The International Global UV Index, stem:[I]~UV~, is defined by the formula:


    stem:[I_((uv)) = k_((er)) int_((250 nm))^((400 nm)) E_(lambda) ( lambda ) s_((er))
    ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[Eλ](stem:[λ]) is the solar spectral irradiance expressed in W·m^−2^·nm^−1^
    at wavelength stem:[λ], stem:[s]~er~(stem:[λ]) is the erythema spectral weighting
    function, and stem:[k]~er~ is a constant equal to 40 m^2^·W^−1^.'
  - The global UV index has unit one.
