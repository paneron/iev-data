  notes:
  - A disconnector is capable of opening and closing a circuit when either negligible
    current is broken or made, or when no significant change in the voltage across
    the terminals of each of the poles of the disconnector occurs. It is also capable
    of carrying currents under normal circuit conditions and carrying for a specified
    time currents under abnormal conditions such as those of short circuit.
