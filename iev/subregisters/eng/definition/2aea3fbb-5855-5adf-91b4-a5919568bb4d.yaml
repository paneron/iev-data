  definition: incidence of an incident wave in a perfect dielectric medium on the
    surface separating it from a medium which is not a perfect dielectric at an angle
    of incidence such that the modulus of the reflection coefficient is minimum for
    a wave that has its electric flux density vector in the plane of incidence
