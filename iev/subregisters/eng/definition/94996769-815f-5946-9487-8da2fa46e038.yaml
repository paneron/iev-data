  definition: 'coefficient of proportionality stem:[R]~H~ in the Hall effect quantitative
    relation:


    stem:[vec E_H = R_H ( vec J xx vec B )]


    stem:[vec E_H] is the resulting transverse electric field strength


    stem:[vec J] is the current density


    stem:[vec B] is the magnetic flux density'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The sign of the majority carrier charge can usually be inferred from the sign
    of the Hall coefficient.
