  definition: ohmic resistance inside a {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}}, measured between
    the {{current collectors, IEV:485-06-07}}, caused by the electronic and ionic
    resistances of the different components (electrodes, electrolyte, bipolar plates
    and current collectors)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term ohmic refers to the fact that the relation between voltage drop and current
    is linear and obeys {{Ohm's law, IEV:131-15-08}}.
