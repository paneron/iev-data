  definition: measurement point at the boundary of a {{fuel cell power system, IEV:485-09-01}}
    at which material or energy, or both, either enters or leaves
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This boundary is intentionally selected to accurately measure the performance
    of the system, including all normal operation, both {{steady state, IEV:485-21-05}}
    and transient. If necessary, the boundary or the interface points of the fuel
    cell power system to be assessed should be determined by agreement between the
    parties.
  - Typical conditions to be standardized refer to fuel and oxidant parameters, like
    compositions, flow rates, temperature, pressure and humidity, as well as to the
    {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}} parameters, like temperature.
