  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the electric constant
    stem:[ε]~0~ and by the electric field strength stem:[*E*]  is equal to the electric
    polarization stem:[*P*]:


    stem:[*P*] = stem:[ε]~0~ stem:[χ] stem:[*E*]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium the electric susceptibility is a scalar; for an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
