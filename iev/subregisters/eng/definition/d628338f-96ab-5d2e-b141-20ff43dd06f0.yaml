  definition: '{{conditional entropy, IEV:171-07-23}} of a specific set of messages
    stem:[Y] at a message sink given a specific set of messages stem:[X] at a message
    source connected to the message sink by a specific channel'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[H_( - ) ( Y | X ) = H_( + ) ( X | Y ) + H ( Y ) - H ( X )] where stem:[H_(
    + ) ( X | Y )] is {{equivocation, IEV:171-07-24}} and stem:[H] is {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}}.
