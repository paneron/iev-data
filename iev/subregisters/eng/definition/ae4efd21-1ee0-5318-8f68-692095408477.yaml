data:
  definition: '{{system, IEV:871-04-31}} or {{IT service, IEV:871-05-08}} that remotely
    records the vital signs and metabolic data (e.g. blood pressure, blood glucose,
    weight, electrocardiogram) and environment data (e.g. ambient air temperature
    and pressure, movement) in the home and out-of-home environment of a patient by
    his or her doctor in charge or by a telemedical care centre'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The objective of a telemonitoring system is to provide optimum care for users
    at all times without the need for travel.
  - Telemonitoring systems are used in different ways for instance in doctor’s surgeries,
    hospitals, telemedical care centres or the home environment.
  - The use of a telemonitoring system in the home environment requires the following
    elements:. sensors (application part);. a base station directly with the patient
    or the person to be assisted, which records the measuring data;. a transmission
    system; . data storage and evaluation at a telemedical care centre, a hospital,
    a doctor’s surgery or another healthcare provider.
  - A telemonitoring system should be designed to meet the following requirements:*
    no disruption of the doctor-patient relationship, but active involvement of doctors
    in charge;* validation by evaluation of the chosen assistance model;* minimal
    invasiveness of sensors for maximum wearing comfort;* high measurement frequency,
    e.g. continuous monitoring of at-risk patients and connection to an emergency
    system;* no restriction in everyday life;* robustness towards changing operating
    and active conditions;* user-friendliness through an intuitive, easy-to-use man-machine
    interface;* clinically verifiable accuracy of measurements.
