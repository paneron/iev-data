  definition: formation of a PN junction by fusing a donor or acceptor substance into
    the surface of a semi-conductor crystal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The re-crystallized region formed on cooling contains impurity atoms which give
    rise to N-type, or P-type conductivity, which differs from that of the host crystal.
  - PNP or NPN junctions are usually formed by alloying from opposite sides of the
    host crystal.
