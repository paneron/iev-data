  definition: the medium in which a variable electric field produces an electric current
    density vector stem:[vec J] whose magnitude in a given direction is large relative
    to that of the vector stem:[((del vec D))/((del t))] in a particular frequency
    band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For a sinusoidal wave in an isotropic medium, the medium is conductive if the
    following relation is satisfied:


    stem:[(sigma)/((epsilon_0 omega)) ≫ epsilon_r^( '' )]


    where stem:[epsilon_r^( '' )] is the relative real permittivity, stem:[ε]~0~ is
    the electric constant, stem:[σ] is the conductivity, stem:[ω] is the angular frequency.'
  - An anisotropic medium may be conducting only in certain directions.
