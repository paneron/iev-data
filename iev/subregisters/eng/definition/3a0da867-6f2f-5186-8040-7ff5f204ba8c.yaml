  definition: the theoretical Poisson traffic intensity that, when offered to a theoretical
    circuit group, produces an overflow traffic intensity distribution with a mean
    and variance equal to that of a given offered traffic
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept of equivalent random traffic intensity makes it possible to take into
    account traffic variance in an indirect way; the theoretical circuit group is
    called "equivalent random circuit group".
