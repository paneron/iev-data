data:
  definition: test of the {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}}'s performance based on a {{fuel
    cell stack, IEV:485-06-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The stack test involves variables that can be related to individual cells (temperature,
    voltage) or the whole stack (such as temperature, {{current density, IEV:485-12-01}},
    fuel and oxidant flow rates, etc.) and adjusted in order to obtain data over a
    wide range of conditions. The outcome of a stack test can be a {{polarization
    curve, IEV:485-15-06}}, a {{single cell, IEV:485-05-02}}'s voltages stability
    plot, or other data related to fuel cell performance.
