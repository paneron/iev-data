  definition: an hypothetical radiating element consisting of a conductor of vanishingly
    small length traversed by a time-varying electric current having at any instant
    the same value at all points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The continuity conditions relating current to charges require that opposite ends
    of the current element be terminated by equal and opposite electric charges, these
    charges being also time-varying. The field of the hertzian dipole can be computed
    either from the current or from the charges.
