  definition: the time over which propagating optical radiation may be considered
    to be coherent radiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coherence time is equal to coherence length divided by the phase velocity
    in a medium.
  - The coherence time is given approximately by stem:[λ]~0~^2^/stem:[c]~0~.Δstem:[λ]
    where stem:[λ]~0~ is the central wavelength, Δstem:[λ] is the spectral linewidth
    and stem:[c]~0~ is the speed of light in vacuum.
