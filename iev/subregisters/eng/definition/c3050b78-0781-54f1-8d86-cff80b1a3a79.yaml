  definition: 'under periodic conditions, ratio of the non-active power stem:[Q]~∼~  to
    the apparent power stem:[S]:


    stem:[lambda_( ∼ ) = ((Q_( ∼ )))/(S)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under sinusoidal conditions, the non-active power factor is the absolute value
    of the reactive factor.
