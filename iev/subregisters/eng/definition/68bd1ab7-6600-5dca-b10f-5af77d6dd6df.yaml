  definition: circuit-theory theorem stating that, if a source voltage in one branch
    of a network produces an electric current in a second branch, then the same source
    voltage acting in the second branch produces the same current in the first branch
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A similar reciprocity theorem can be expressed using current sources.
