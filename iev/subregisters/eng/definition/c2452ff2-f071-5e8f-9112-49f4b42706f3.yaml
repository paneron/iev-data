  definition: variation of a {{field, IEV:102-05-12}} moving with a velocity well
    defined at each point of a medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Electromagnetic and acoustic waves in linear media are represented by particular
    solutions of hyperbolic second order partial differential equations in space and
    time, for example resulting from Maxwell equations.
