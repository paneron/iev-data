  definition: orientation of the crystal element with respect to the crystallographic
    axes of the crystal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It may be desirable to specify the crystal cut (and hence the general form of
    the frequency/temperature performance) of a crystal unit used in an oscillator
    application. The choice of the crystal cut will imply certain attributes of the
    oscillator which may not otherwise appear in the detail specification.
