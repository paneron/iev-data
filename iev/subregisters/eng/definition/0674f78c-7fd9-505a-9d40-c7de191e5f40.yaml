  definition: a transmission channel normally handling signals which leave a given
    point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These qualifications are usually highly localized, for example a channel referred
    to as a go channel at one point in a network may be referred to as a return channel
    at another point.
  - In telephony, the English qualifiers "go" and "transmit" may be considered to
    be synonymous. In certain applications, for example in television transmission,
    only the transmit channel will exist. In this case, the use of the term "go channel"
    is not applicable.
