data:
  definition: the applied magnetic field strength necessary to bring magnetic flux
    density, magnetic polarization or the magnetization of a magnetized material to
    zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a graphical representation it is the value corresponding to any intersection
    with stem:[H]-axis of the magnetization curve (for flux density, polarization
    or magnetization).
  - The coercive field strength may refer to the static or dynamic magnetization.
    When unqualified, the static curve is assumed.
