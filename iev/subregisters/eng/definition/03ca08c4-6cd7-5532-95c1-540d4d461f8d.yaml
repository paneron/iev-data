  definition: condition in which some peak values of the {{modulating signal, IEV:702-06-04}}
    exceed the maximum value for which the {{transmission system, IEV:704-04-19}}
    or the equipment considered is designed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In {{full carrier, IEV:702-06-22}} {{amplitude modulation, IEV:702-06-17}}, the
    maximum value is that corresponding to a 100 % {{modulation factor, IEV:702-06-19}},
    definition 1.
