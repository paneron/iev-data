  definition: maximum peak value of periodic excursions of the voltage waveform resulting
    from distortions of an AC voltage or from AC components superimposed on a DC voltage
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Random overvoltages, for example due to occasional switching, are not considered
    to be recurring peak voltages.
