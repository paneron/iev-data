  definition: mark attributed to an instant by means of a specified timescale
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 On a timescale consisting of successive steps, two distinct instants may be
    expressed by the same date (see Note 1 of the term "timescale" in {{113-01-11,
    IEV:113-01-11}}).
  - 2 With respect to the specified timescale, a date may also be considered as the
    duration between the origin of the timescale and the considered instant.
  - 3 In common language, the term “date” is mainly used when the timescale is a calendar
    as a sequence of days.
