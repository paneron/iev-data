data:
  definition: interaction in a {{non-linear, IEV:131-11-19}} device or transmission
    medium between the {{spectral components, IEV:702-04-41}} of the {{input, IEV:151-15-13}}
    signal or signals producing new spectral components having frequencies equal to
    linear combinations with integral coefficients of the frequencies of the input
    spectral components
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Intermodulation can result from a single non-sinusoidal input signal or from several
    sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal input signals applied to the same or to different
    inputs.
