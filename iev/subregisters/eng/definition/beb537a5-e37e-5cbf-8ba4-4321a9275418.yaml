data:
  definition: a paired-disparity code employing a ternary digital signal to convey
    binary digits, in which the binary 1 states are represented by signal elements
    that are normally of alternate positive and negative polarity but equal in amplitude,
    and in which binary 0 states are represented by signal elements having zero amplitude
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In telegraphy and data communication, the binary 1 state is known as the Z state
    (or "mark") and the binary 0 state is known as the A state (or "space").
