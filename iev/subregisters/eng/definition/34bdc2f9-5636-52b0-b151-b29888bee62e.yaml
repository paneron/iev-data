  definition: '1. when a load is directly connected to a given source, the conditions
    under which either exchangeable power or available power from the source, or maximum
    current or voltage in the load, or minimum reflection factor at the interface
    between the source and the load is obtained


    2. for a given source and a given load an action whereby maximum power, current
    or voltage is obtained in the load or minimum power is reflected to the source,
    either by insertion of a two port device of appropriate characteristics between
    the source and the load, or by variation of the load or source characteristics'

  notes:
  - 'In French, examples of matching are: "adaptation en courant", "adaptation en
