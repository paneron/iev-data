  definition: at a stated operating point and frequency, the quotient of (1) the fundamental
    frequency component of the current into the accessible terminal of an electrode
    by (2) the sinusoidal voltage applied to that terminal to cause the current, all
    other terminal potentials being maintained constant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For infinitesimal amplitudes, this is the reciprocal of the electrode impedance.
