data:
  definition: the value of the coercive field strength in a material when the magnetic
    flux density, magnetic polarization or magnetization is alternating at an amplitude
    corresponding to the saturation hysteresis loop
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The relevant parameter should be stated, and the appropriate symbol used as follows
    : stem:[H'']~cstem:[B]~ for the cyclic coercivity relating to the flux density,
    stem:[H'']~cstem:[J]~ for the cyclic coercivity relating to the polarization,
    stem:[H'']~cstem:[M]~ for the cyclic coercivity relating to the magnetization.
    The first two symbols supersede stem:[BH'']~c~ and stem:[JH'']~c~.'
