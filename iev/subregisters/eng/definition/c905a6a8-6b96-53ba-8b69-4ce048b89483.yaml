  notes:
  - In some cases (e.g. electronic tubes and semiconductor devices), the term "positive
    electrode" is applied to one or another electrode, depending on the electric operating
    condition of the device. In other cases (e.g. electrochemical cells), the term
    "positive electrode" is assigned to a specific electrode.
