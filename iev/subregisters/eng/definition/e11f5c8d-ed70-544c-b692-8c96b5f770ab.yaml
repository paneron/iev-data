  definition: ratio of the luminous output of a source evaluated according to the
    CIE scotopic <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>, stem:[V′](stem:[λ]),
    to the luminous output evaluated according to the CIE photopic spectral luminous
    efficiency, stem:[V](stem:[λ])
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The S/P ratio can be expressed by


    stem:[R_((SP)) = ((K^( '' )_m int_0^(oo) S ( lambda ) V^( '' ) ( lambda ) d lambda))/((K_m
    int_0^(oo) S ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda))]


    where stem:[K]′~m~ ≈ 1 700 lm·W^−1^ is the maximum luminous efficacy for scotopic
    vision, stem:[K]~m~ ≈ 683 lm·W^−1^ is the maximum luminous efficacy for photopic
    vision, stem:[S](stem:[λ]) is the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a>
    of the source, and stem:[λ] is the wavelength.'
  - The S/P ratio has unit one.
