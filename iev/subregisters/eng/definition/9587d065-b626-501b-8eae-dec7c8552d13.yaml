  definition: 'for a passive linear two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with
    terminals A and B under sinusoidal conditions, quotient of the phasor stem:[(underset(_)(U))_((AB))]
    representing the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals
    by the phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)] representing the electric current in the element
    or circuit


    stem:[underset(_)(Z) = (((underset(_)(U))_((A B))))/((underset(_)(I)))]


    where the sinusoidal voltage stem:[u_((A B)) = v_A - v_B] represented by the phasor
    stem:[(underset(_)(U))_((AB))] is the difference of the electric potentials stem:[v_A]
    at A and stem:[v_B] at B, and where the sinusoidal electric current represented
    by the phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)] is taken positive if its direction is from
    A to B and negative if its direction is from B to A'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The impedance of an element or circuit is the inverse of its admittance. It is
    equal to stem:[underset(_)(Z) = R + j X = Z e^(j phi)], where stem:[R] is resistance
    to alternating current, stem:[X] is reactance, stem:[Z] is apparent impedance,
    and stem:[φ] is displacement angle.
  - 'With a suitable qualifier, the word impedance is used to form composite terms
    designating quantities of the same kind as impedance, e.g.: transfer impedance,
    characteristic impedance.'
  - The coherent SI unit of impedance is ohm, Ω.
