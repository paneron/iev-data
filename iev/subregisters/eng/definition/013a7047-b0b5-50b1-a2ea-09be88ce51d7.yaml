  definition: for a given mode at a given frequency in a transmission line, the quotient
    of the natural logarithm of the ratio of a specified field vector component at
    one transverse cross-section to that at another transverse cross-section, by the
    distance between these two crosssections in the direction of propagation, when
    the transmission line is infinite in length or terminated in its characteristic
    impedance
