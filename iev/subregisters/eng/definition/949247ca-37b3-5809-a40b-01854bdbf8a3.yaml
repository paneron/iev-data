  definition: method to determine the coefficients of the AC magnetic susceptibility
    by measuring the magnetic flux in a detection coil when the sample is put in an
    alternating magnetic field of low frequency (several Hz to several kHz) and low
    flux density (of the order of 1 mT or even below)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This method is used to obtain the critical current density and the irreversibility
    line.
