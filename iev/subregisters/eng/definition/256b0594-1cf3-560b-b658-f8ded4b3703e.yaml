  definition: for a polyphase line mean value, taken over one period, of the instantaneous
    power
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a three-phase line under symmetric and sinusoidal conditions, the active power
    is stem:[P = U I sqrt(3) cos varphi], where stem:[U] is the RMS value of any line-to-line
    voltage, stem:[I] is the RMS value of any line current and stem:[Ï•]  is the displacement
    angle between any line-to-neutral voltage and the corresponding line current.
