  definition: 'for a three-position element without differential gap the range between
    the two switching values and for a three-position element with differential gaps
    the range between the two pairs of switching values according to special agreement


    SEE: Figure 20.'

  notes:
  - For a three-position element with differential gaps the neutral zone is normally
    defined as the difference between the mean values of the two pairs of switching
    values.
