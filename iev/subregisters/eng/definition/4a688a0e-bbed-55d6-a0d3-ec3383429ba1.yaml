data:
  definition: continuous supply of a protective gas, after purging, at such a rate
    that the concentration of a flammable substance inside the pressurized enclosure
    is maintained at a value outside the flammable limits at any potential ignition
    source (that is to say, outside the dilution area)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Dilution of oxygen by inert gas can result in a concentration of flammable gas
    or vapour above the upper flammable limit (UFL).
