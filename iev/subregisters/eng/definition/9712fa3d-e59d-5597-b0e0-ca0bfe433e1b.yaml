  definition: characteristic time constant of coupling current directed perpendicularly
    to filaments within a strand for low frequencies
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coupling time constant is proportional to the square of the twist pitch length
    and inversely proportional to resistivity of the matrix.
  - The coupling time constant is one of the parameters expressing magnitude of coupling
    loss and is proportional to the loss.
