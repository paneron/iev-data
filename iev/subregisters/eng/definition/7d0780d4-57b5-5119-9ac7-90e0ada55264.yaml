data:
  definition: for a two-terminal element or a two-terminal circuit supplied by a periodic
    voltage, component of the electric current proportional to the voltage with a
    proportionality factor equal to the active power divided by the square of the
    rms voltage
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the supplied voltage is sinusoidal, the active current is that component
    of the electric current in the element or circuit which has the same frequency
    as the voltage and is in phase with it.
