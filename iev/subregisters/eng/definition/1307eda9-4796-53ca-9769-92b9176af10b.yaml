  definition: a digital signal having a digit rate standardized by CCITT, primarily
    for use in the standardized digital multiplex hierarchy
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A standardized digital signal may or may not be a multiplexed assembly of standardized
    digital signals from a lower hierarchical level.
  - Examples of such signals are "standardized 2 048 kbit/s digital signal" and "standardized
    44 736 kbit/s digital signal", which may be abbreviated to "2 048 kbit/s digital
    signal" and "44 736 kbit/s digital signal" or, by convention, to "2 Mbit/s signal"
    and "45 Mbit/s signal".
