  definition: ". 0,5-fractile of a probability distribution \n\n.  for stem:[n] real\
    \ values not necessarily different from each other, real number such that the\
    \ number of values less than it is equal to the number of values greater than\
    \ it"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If stem:[n] is odd, the median is the value of rank stem:[( n + 1 ) // 2] when
    the values are arranged in increasing order. If stem:[n] is even, the median may
    be any number between the values of rank stem:[n // 2] and stem:[( n // 2 + 1
    )], usually the arithmetic mean of these two values.
