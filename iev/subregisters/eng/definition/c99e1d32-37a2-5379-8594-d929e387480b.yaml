  definition: ratio of the phasor representing the reflected voltage to the phasor
    representing the incident voltage at a port of an electric network or close to
    a discontinuity in a transmission line
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At a port of an electric network, the complex voltage reflection factor is by
    convention the negative of the complex current reflection factor.
  - 'When impedances can be defined, the complex voltage reflection factor equals:


    stem:[underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) '' - underset(_)(Z)))/((underset(_)(Z)
    '' + underset(_)(Z)))]


    where <u>stem:[Z]</u> is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line
    ahead of the discontinuity or the impedance of the source, and <u>stem:[Z]</u>â€²
    is the impedance after the discontinuity or the load impedance seen from the junction
    between the source and the load.'
  - The terms "complex voltage reflection factor" and "complex tension reflection
    factor" may be shortened by omitting "complex" and/or "voltage" or "tension" in
    an appropriate context.
