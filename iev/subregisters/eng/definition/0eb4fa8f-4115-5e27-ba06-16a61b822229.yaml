  definition: process by which radiation is returned by a surface or a medium, without
    change in the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} of its monochromatic components
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Part of the radiation falling on a medium is reflected at the surface of the medium
    ("surface reflection"); another part can be scattered back from the interior of
    the medium ("volume reflection").
  - The frequency is unchanged only if there is no Doppler effect due to the motion
    of the materials from which the radiation is returned.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-42 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
