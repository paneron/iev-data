  definition: '{{distortion, IEV:702-07-43}} of a {{signal, IEV:101-12-02}} resulting
    from the {{quantization, IEV:702-04-07}} of an original signal'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The terms "quantizing distortion" and "quantizing noise" are usually restricted
    to the effect occurring within the {{working range, IEV:704-24-10}} of the quantizer.
  - The term “quantizing noise” originated because the distortion usually has the
    appearance of a {{random noise, IEV:161-02-14}} superimposed on the signal carrying
    {{information, IEV:101-12-01}}.
