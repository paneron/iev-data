  definition: set of points of a point space or of a plane, the position vector of
    which is a continuous function stem:[r = f ( u )], where the parameter stem:[u]
    is a real number in a given interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A plane curve can also be defined algebraically by the equation stem:[f ( x ,
    y ) = 0].
