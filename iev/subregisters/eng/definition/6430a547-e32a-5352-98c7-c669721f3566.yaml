  notes:
  - 'The purpose of error recovery is to avoid a failure of the whole system, following
    a failure of one of its subsystems or components.


    Note 2: See also backward error recovery ({{192-10-17, IEV:192-10-17}}) and forward
    error recovery ({{192-10-18, IEV:192-10-18}}).


    Note 3: Error recovery often makes use of redundancy and diversity.'
