      type: modified
  definition: publication of a national {{normative document, IEV:901-02-01}} based
    on a relevant {{international standard, IEV:901-02-03}}, or endorsement of the
    international standard as having the same status as a national normative document,
    with any deviations from the international standard identified
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “adoption” is sometimes used to cover the same concept as “taking over”,
    e.g. “adoption of an international standard in a national standard”.
  - A normative document can be said to be “implemented” in two different ways. It
    may be applied in production, trade, etc., and it may be taken over, wholly or
    in part, in another normative document. Through the medium of this second document,
    it may then be applied, or it may again be taken over in yet another normative
    document.
