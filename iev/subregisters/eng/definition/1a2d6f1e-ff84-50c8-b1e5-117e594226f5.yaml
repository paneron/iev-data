  definition: subset of a set, which is different from the set
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The notation stem:[A sub B] expresses that the set stem:[A] is a proper subset
    of the set stem:[B]. The symbol stem:[underset(!=)( sub )] is sometimes used instead
    of stem:[sub] but is not recommended, and it should be used when the latter is
    used for any subset of stem:[B]. stem:[A] is also said to be properly included
    in stem:[B].
