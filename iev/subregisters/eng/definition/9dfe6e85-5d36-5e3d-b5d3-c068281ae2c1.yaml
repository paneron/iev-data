  definition: at a given frequency, quotient of a dynamic field quantity (such as
    force, sound pressure) by a kinematic field quantity (such as vibration velocity,
    particle velocity), or quotient of a voltage by a current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term impedance is generally applied to a linear system and to steady sinusoidal
    signals.
  - In the case of a transient, impedance as a function of frequency is the quotient
    of the respective Fourier or Laplace transforms.
  - An impedance is the quotient of two quantities the product of which has the dimensions
    of power or power per unit area.
