data:
  definition: for a derivative element, quantity equal to the derivative action coefficient,
    if its input and output variables are variable quantities of the same kind
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Then the derivative action time is given by stem:[T]~D~ = stem:[K]~D~, where stem:[K]~D~
    is the derivative action coefficient.
  - The derivative action time can also be given as the duration of the time interval
    required by a rampwise variation of the input variable of a derivative element
    to reach the value of the stepwise variation of its output variable.
  - This entry was numbered 351-28-26 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
