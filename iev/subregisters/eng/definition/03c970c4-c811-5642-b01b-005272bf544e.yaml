  definition: 'under sinusoidal conditions, product of the phasor stem:[underset(_)(U)]
    representing the voltage between the terminals of a linear two-terminal element
    or two-terminal circuit and the complex conjugate of the phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)]
    representing the electric current in the element or circuit


    stem:[underset(_)(S) = underset(_)(U) underset(_)(I) *]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Complex power is equal to stem:[P + j Q], where stem:[P] is active power and stem:[Q]
    is reactive power.
  - The coherent SI unit for complex power is voltampere, VA.
