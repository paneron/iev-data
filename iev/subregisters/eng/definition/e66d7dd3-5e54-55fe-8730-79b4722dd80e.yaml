  definition: 'value of deceleration stem:[Î³]~a~ obtained by dividing the reduction
    in speed by the time taken to effect it


    stem:[gamma_a = ((V_i - V_t))/(t)]


    where


    stem:[V]~i~ is the initial speed measured at the moment of the operation of the
    control device for the brake;

    stem:[V]~t~ is the final speed obtained at the end of the braking;

    stem:[t] is the time between the moment of operation of the control device for
    the brake and the moment at which the final speed is attained'
