  definition: electromedical apparatus that uses the heat generated by the passage
    of high-frequency current, of the order of one megahertz, between an active, punctiform
    electrode and an electrode of greater surface area placed in close contact with
    the skin
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The heat is generated at the active electrode, where the current density is greatest.
  - The active electrode can be used to cut or to coagulate.
