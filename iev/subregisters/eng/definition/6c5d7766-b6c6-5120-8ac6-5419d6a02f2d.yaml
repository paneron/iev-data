data:
  definition: 'luminance that, when added by superposition to the luminance of both
    the adapting background and the object, makes the luminance threshold or the luminance
    difference threshold the same under the two following conditions: (1) glare present,
    but no additional luminance; (2) additional luminance present, but no glare'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The equivalent veiling luminance is expressed in candela per square metre (cd·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-02-58 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
