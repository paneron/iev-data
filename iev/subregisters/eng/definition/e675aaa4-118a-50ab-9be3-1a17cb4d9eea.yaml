  definition: the time average direction of the flow of energy of an electromagnetic
    wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - With certain reservations, the direction of propagation of energy is that of the
    time average of the Poynting vector.
  - The direction of propagation of energy of an electromagnetic wave may differ from
    the direction of propagation of the wave. In practice, if the medium is not too
    absorbent, nor too anisotropic, nor too dispersive, the direction of propagation
    of energy is identical to the direction of the group velocity vector.
