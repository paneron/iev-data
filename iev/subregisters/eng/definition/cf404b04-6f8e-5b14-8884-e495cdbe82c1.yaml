  definition: 'unbiased estimate of the preferred definition in the time domain of
    the short-term stability characteristic of the oscillator output frequency given
    by


    stem:[sigma_y ^2 ( tau ) tilde= (1)/((M – 1)) sum_((k = 1))^((M – 1)) ((( Y_((k
    + 1)) – Y_k )^2))/(2)]


    where


    stem:[Y]~stem:[k]~ are the average fractional frequency fluctuations obtained
    sequentially, with no systematic dead time between measurements;


    stem:[τ] is the sample time over which the measurements are averaged;


    stem:[M] is the number of measurements'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The confidence of the estimate improves as stem:[M] increases.
  - This entry was numbered 561-04-18 in IEC 60050-561:1991.
