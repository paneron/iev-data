  definition: length describing the spatial variation of the order parameter in the
    Ginzburg-Landau theory
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[ξ] called the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length is a function of temperature
    and nearly equal to the BCS coherence length, stem:[ξ]~0~, at 0 K in a clean superconductor
    ({{815-10-35, IEV:815-10-35}}).
  - stem:[ξ] = (stem:[Φ]~0~/2πstem:[μ]~0~stem:[H]~c2~)^1/2^, where stem:[Φ]~0~ is
    the flux quantum, stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant and stem:[H]~c2~ is the
    upper critical field strength.
