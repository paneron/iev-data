  definition: 'quotient impulse response Δstem:[v]~δ~(stem:[t]) divided by the impulse
    area stem:[K]~δ~ of the impulse function, the quotient described by


    stem:[g ( t ) = (1)/((K_(delta))) * Delta v_( delta ) ( t )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The unit-impulse response stem:[g](stem:[t]) of a system contains all properties
    of the system and is used to calculate the response Δstem:[v](stem:[t]) of the
    system to any input variable Δstem:[u](stem:[t]) by the convolution integral


    stem:[Delta v ( t ) = int_((- oo))^(oo) g ( tau ) * Delta u ( t - tau ) d tau].'
  - 'The systems frequency response stem:[G ( j * omega )] may be calculated by Fourier
    transformation of stem:[g](stem:[t]):


    stem:[G ( j * omega ) = ℱ { g ( t ) }].'
  - The unit-impulse response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit impulse to an input variable.
