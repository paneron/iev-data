  definition: qualifies or supplements a {{quantity name, IEV:112-01-02}} to indicate
    the quotient of that quantity by the wavelength or the frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The wavelength is used mainly in optics, and the frequency in radioelectricity,
    acoustics, and signal theory. Examples: {{power spectral density, IEV:103-09-05}},
    {{spectral irradiance, IEV:731-01-30}}.'
  - The adjective “spectral” is also used to designate quantities which are functions
    of wavelength or frequency, but which are not spectral concentrations, for example
    spectral emissivity. See {{IEV 845-01-16, IEV:845-01-16}}.
