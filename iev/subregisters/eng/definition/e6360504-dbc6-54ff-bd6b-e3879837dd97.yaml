  definition: for a given array antenna, the radiation pattern function which would
    be obtained if all the elements of the array would be radiated isotropically
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the radiation pattern function of all the radiating elements of the array are
    identical and if these elements are congruent by translation, then the product
    of the array factor and the element radiation pattern function gives the radiation
    pattern of the entire array antenna.
