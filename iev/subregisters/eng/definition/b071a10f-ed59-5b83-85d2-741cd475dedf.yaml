  definition: gain as a function of the angular frequency stem:[ω]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In graphical representation the gain is usually plotted as logarithmic gain versus
    the logarithmically represented value of the angular frequency stem:[ω] (see Figure
    10).
  - The gain response is the modulus of the frequency response.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-36 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
