  definition: 'a normal mode where the subscripts stem:[m] and stem:[n] added to the
    abbreviations ТМ are assigned by observing the cross-sectional variation of the
    transverse magnetic field vector:


    1 – In a rectangular waveguide subscripts stem:[m] and stem:[n], in that order,
    indicate the number of half-period variations of the mainly transverse field vector
    along paths parallel to the wide and narrow walls respectively.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The reverse notation, where the stem:[m] and stem:[n] paths are parallel to the
    narrow and wide walls respectively is deprecated.


    2 – In a circular waveguide subscript stem:[m] indicates the number of full-period
    variations of the transverse field vector along a circular path concentric with
    the wall, and subscript stem:[n] indicates the number of reversals of the same
    vector along a radial path, plus one'
