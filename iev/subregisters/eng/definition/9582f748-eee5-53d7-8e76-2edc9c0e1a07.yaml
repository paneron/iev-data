  definition: 'for a resistive two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, quotient of the electric current stem:[i] in the element or circuit by
    the voltage stem:[u]~AB~ ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals


    stem:[G = (i)/((u_((AB))))]


    where the electric current is taken positive if its direction is from A to B and
    negative if its direction is from B to A'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The conductance of an element or circuit is the inverse of its resistance.
  - The term "conductance" is also a short term for “conductance to alternating current”
    ({{131-12-53, IEV:131-12-53}}).
  - The coherent SI unit of conductance is siemens, S.
