  definition: unit of energy equal to the difference in potential energy of an electron
    in two positions with electric potential difference of one volt
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1  Electronvolt is often defined as the kinetic energy acquired by an electron
    in passing through an electric potential difference of 1 V in vacuum.
  - 2 1 eV = 1,602 176 487(40) × 10^−19^ J (CODATA 2006). The electronvolt is accepted
    for use with the SI and is often combined with the SI prefixes.
