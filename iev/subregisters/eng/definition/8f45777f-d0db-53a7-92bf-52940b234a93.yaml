  definition: 'quotient of the emitted luminous flux and the power consumed


    stem:[eta_v = ((Phi_v))/(P)]


    where stem:[Φ]~v~ is luminous flux and stem:[P] is the power consumed by the light
    source'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It has to be specified whether or not the power dissipated by auxiliary equipment
    such as ballasts, if any, is included in the power consumed by the light source.
  - The luminous efficacy of a light source is expressed in lumen per watt (lm·W^−1^).
