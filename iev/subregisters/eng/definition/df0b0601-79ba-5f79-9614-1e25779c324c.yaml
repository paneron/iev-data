  definition: lighting design technique where the light falls on objects from a direction
    opposite to that of the traffic
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Counter-beam lighting is characterized by using luminaires that show a luminous
    intensity distribution that is asymmetric in relation to the plane normal to the
    direction of the traffic, where the maximum luminous intensity is aimed against
    the direction of the traffic. The term refers only to the direction of normal
    travel.
