  definition: the greatest angle of incidence for which a wave propagating in a homogeneous
    medium of relatively high refractive index strikes an interface with a medium
    having a lower refractive index, and for which refraction is just possible
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When light propagates in a homogeneous medium of relatively high refractive index
    (stem:[n]~high~) onto a planar interface with a homogeneous material of lower
    index (stem:[n]~low~ ), the critical angle is defined by :


    arcsin (stem:[n]~low~ / stem:[n]~high~)'
