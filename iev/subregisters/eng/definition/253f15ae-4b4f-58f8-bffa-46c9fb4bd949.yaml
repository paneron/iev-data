  definition: repetitive time interval constituting a complete cycle for the transmission
    of {{traffic bursts, IEV:725-14-27}} by the {{terminals, IEV:701-02-08}} and within
    which some, but not necessarily all, control functions are performed once

  notes:
  - In English, the term "frame" has different meanings in the fields of time division
    multiplexing (see {{IEV 704-14-01, IEV:704-14-01}}), switching (see {{IEV 714-15-09,
    IEV:714-15-09}}), television (see {{IEV 723-05-25, IEV:723-05-25}}), time division
    multiple access (see {{IEV 725-14-18, IEV:725-14-18}}), digital processing (see
