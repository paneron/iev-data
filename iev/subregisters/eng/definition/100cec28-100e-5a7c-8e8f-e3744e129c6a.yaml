  definition: load voltage of a welding power source corresponding to the conventional
    welding condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The values for stem:[U]~2~ are given as r.m.s. values for AC and arithmetic mean
    values for DC.
  - The conventional load voltage has a specified linear relationship to the conventional
    welding current. This relationship varies in accordance with the process.
