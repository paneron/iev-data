data:
  definition: an ideal dielectric medium in which a variable electric field produces
    an electric current density vector stem:[vec J] of zero magnitude in a given direction
    in a particular frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a homogeneous medium, the medium is a perfect dielectric in a given direction
    if the conductivity stem:[Ïƒ] may be considered zero in this direction.
  - Vacuum is a perfect dielectric at any frequency.
