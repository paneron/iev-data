  definition: duration (over which the threshold power is averaged) during which energy
    deposited by the spark accumulates in a small volume of gas around it without
    significant thermal dissipation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For times shorter than the thermal initiation time the total energy deposited
    by the spark will determine whether or not ignition occurs. For increasingly longer
    times, the power or rate at which energy is deposited becomes the determining
    factor for ignition.
