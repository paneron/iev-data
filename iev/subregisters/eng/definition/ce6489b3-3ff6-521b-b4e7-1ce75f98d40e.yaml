data:
  definition: quotient of the vertical optical thickness of a real turbid atmosphere
    and the vertical optical thickness of the pure and dry atmosphere (Rayleigh atmosphere),
    related to the visible part of the solar spectrum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The luminous turbidity factor can be expressed by


    stem:[T_v = ((- ln ( E_((vs)) // E_v )))/((a_v m))]


    where stem:[E]~vs~ is the direct-beam illuminance on a horizontal surface (at
    the ground), stem:[E]~v~ is the extraterrestrial horizontal illuminance, stem:[a]~v~
    is the luminous extinction coefficient, and stem:[m] is the relative optical air
    mass.'
  - The luminous turbidity factor has unit one.
