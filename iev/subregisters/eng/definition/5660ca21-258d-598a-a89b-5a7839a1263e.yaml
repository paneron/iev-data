  definition: protection in which the residual current from a set of three-phase current
    transformers is balanced against the residual output from a similar set of current
    transformers or, more usually, from a single current transformer located on the
    earthing connection, if any, of a neutral point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This term is also used when the neutral of the protected plant is unearthed i.e.
    neither a second set of three-phase current transformers nor a current transformer
    in the neutral connection is needed to restrict the protected section.
