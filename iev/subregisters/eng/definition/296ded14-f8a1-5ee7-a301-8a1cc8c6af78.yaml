  definition: a magnetic material having a low coercivity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'A specific value of coercivity defining the boundary between magnetically hard
    and soft materials cannot easily be stated : it lies in the region 1 to 10 kA/m.'
  - Certain magnetically soft iron alloys, for example silicon iron, used in electrical
    applications are commonly referred to as electrical steels and in some cases in
    French as "tôles magnétiques".
