  notes:
  - A winding is provided with terminals and is intended to produce a magnetic field
    when carrying electric currents or to produce voltages between appropriate points
    when placed in a time-varying magnetic field or moved through a magnetic field.
  - The number of turns in a winding is denoted stem:[N]. This number may be non-integer.
