  definition: 'scalar constant stem:[ε]~0~ linking the electric quantities and the
    mechanical quantities, obtained from the relation


    stem:[F = (1)/((4 pi epsilon_0)) * ((| Q_1 Q_2 |))/((r^2))]


    based on Coulomb''s law in vacuum, where stem:[F]  is the magnitude of the force
    between two particles with electric charges stem:[Q]~1~  and stem:[Q]~2~ respectively,
    placed at a distance stem:[r] apart'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the product of the electric constant and the electric field strength
    *stem:[E]*  is equal to the electric flux density *stem:[D]*:


    *stem:[D]* = stem:[ε]~0~*stem:[E]*'
  - 'The electric constant is related to the magnetic constant stem:[μ]~0~ and to
    the speed of light in vacuum stem:[c]~0~ by the relation


    stem:[ε]~0~stem:[μ]~0~stem:[c]~0~^2^ = 1'
  - 'The value of the electric constant is exactly equal to


    stem:[((10^7))/((4 pi xx 299 792 458^2)) m^(- 3) kg^(- 1) s^4 A^2 = 8 , 854 187
    817 ... pF // m]'
