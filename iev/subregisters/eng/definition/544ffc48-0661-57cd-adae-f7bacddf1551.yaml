  definition: the highest operating voltage for an X-ray tube specified by the manufacturer
    for the operating conditions (e.g., 2.5 h operation) and the high-voltage waveform
    (e.g., single-peak generator) under consideration. In the case of single-peak
    generators the maximum rated tube voltage is measured during the load period
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Indication of the maximum rated tube voltage, unless stated to the contrary, always
    refers to the peak value.
  - For different operating conditions – for example continuous, intermittent, and
    short time (radiographic operation) – it is possible to have different maximum
    rated tube voltage.
  - In the case of single peak generators the value of the voltage during the load
    period (which determines the radiation emitted) and the inverse voltage (which
    determines the maximum voltage to which the tube will be subjected during operation)
    can be different.
