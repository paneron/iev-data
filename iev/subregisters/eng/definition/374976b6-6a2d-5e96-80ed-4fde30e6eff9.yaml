  definition: the radiant power in a given direction and at a given point of a real
    or hypothetical surface transmitted by an elementary beam passing through the
    given point and propagating in the solid angle containing the given direction
    divided by the product of the value of this solid angle, the area of section of
    that beam containing the given point and the cosine of the angle between the normal
    to that section and the direction of the beam
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The surface may be that of a source or a surface emitting, receiving or intersecting
    a light beam.
