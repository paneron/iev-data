  examples: []
  notes:
  - Shot noise appears essentially in semiconductor devices or electron tubes.
  - Shot noise has a continuous spectrum and may be considered as white noise in a
    frequency band between very low frequencies and the higher frequencies where effects
    such as transit time become dominant.
