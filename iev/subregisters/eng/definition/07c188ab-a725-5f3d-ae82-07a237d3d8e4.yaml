  definition: difference between the scalar magnetic potentials at two points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The difference between the scalar potential of an irrotational magnetic field
    strength at a point b and that at a point a is equal to the negative of the line
    integral of the magnetic field strength along any path linking points a and b.
