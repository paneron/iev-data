  definition: ratio expressed in decibels, of a wanted signal voltage to the noise
    voltage at the output of a tape recorder
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The signal output voltage is expressed with respect to a given amount of harmonic
    distortion, obtained by recording a specified frequency signal on a specified
    recording medium.
  - The noise voltage is measured, weighted or unweighted in the absence of a wanted
