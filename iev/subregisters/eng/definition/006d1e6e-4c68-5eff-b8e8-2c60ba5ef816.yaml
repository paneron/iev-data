  definition: '{{energy not supplied, IEV:692-09-06}} by an {{electric power system,
    IEV:692-01-02}} during a given incident divided by the annual peak load'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the energy not supplied is expressed in megawatt-minutes, and the annual peak
    load in megawatts, this index is often referred to as "system-minutes". One minute
    of this quantity is equivalent in energy to an interruption of the total system
    load for one minute at the time when the annual system peak load occurs.
  - The annual system peak load refers to the highest load in that year.
  - This entry was numbered 191-30-03 in IEC 60050-191:1990.
