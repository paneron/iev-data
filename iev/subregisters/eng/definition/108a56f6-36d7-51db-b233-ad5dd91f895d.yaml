  definition: 'quotient of the mean of the values of luminance, stem:[L], measured
    at 20° and 70° (0,35 rad and 1,22 rad) and the luminance measured at 5° (0,09
    rad) from the normal, when the surface considered is illuminated normally


    stem:[sigma = ((L ( 20 ° ) + L ( 70 ° )))/((2 L ( 5 ° )))]'

  notes:
  - The diffusion factor is intended to give an indication of the spatial distribution
    of the diffused flux. It is equal to 1 for every isotropic diffuser, whatever
    the value of the diffuse reflectance or diffuse transmittance.
  - This way of defining the diffusion factor can be applied only to materials for
    which the scattering indicatrix does not differ appreciably from that of ordinary
    opal glasses.
  - For indicating the shape of the scattering indicatrix it is recommended that the
    diffusion factor, stem:[σ], be used for strongly diffusing materials, and the
    half-value angle, stem:[γ], for poorly diffusing materials.
  - The diffusion factor has unit one.
