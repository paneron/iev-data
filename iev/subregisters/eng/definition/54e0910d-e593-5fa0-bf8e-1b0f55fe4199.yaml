  definition: 'particular interface of an equipment which couples this equipment with
    the external electromagnetic environment ({{161-01-01, IEV:161-01-01}}) and through
    which the equipment is influenced by this environment


    EXAMPLE Examples of ports of interest are shown in Figure 1. The enclosure port
    is the physical boundary of the apparatus (e.g. enclosure). The enclosure port
    provides for radiated and electrostatic discharge ({{161-01-22, IEV:161-01-22}})
    energy transfer, whereas the other ports provide for conducted energy transfer.
