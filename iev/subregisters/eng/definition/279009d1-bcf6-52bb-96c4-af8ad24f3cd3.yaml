    original: IEC 62047-1:2016, 2.6.5, modified â€“ "Surface activated bonding" has
      been replaced with "surface-activated bonding".

    relationship:
      modification: '"Surface activated bonding" has been replaced with "surface-activated
        bonding".'
      type: modified
  definition: process for {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} two {{substrates, IEV:521-05-28}}
    directly by increasing the surface energy of each substrate using ion beam or
    plasma irradiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Surface-activated bonding is effective in reducing thermal stress because the
    temperature in the bonding process is comparably low.  In MEMS {{devices, IEV:151-11-20}},
    surface-activated bonding is expected to be applied to the substrate bonding such
    as hermetic sealing.
