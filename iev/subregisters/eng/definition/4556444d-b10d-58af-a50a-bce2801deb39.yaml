  definition: 'particular design of meter, manufactured by one manufacturer, having:


    a) similar metrological properties;


    b) the same uniform construction of parts determining these properties;


    c) the same ratio of the maximum current to the reference current'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The type may have several values of reference current and reference voltage.
  - Meters are designated by the manufacturer by one or more groups of letters or
    numbers, or a combination of letters and numbers. Each type has one designation
    only.
  - The type is represented by the sample meter(s) intended for the type tests and
    whose characteristics (reference current and reference voltage) are chosen from
    the values given in the tables proposed by the manufacturer.
