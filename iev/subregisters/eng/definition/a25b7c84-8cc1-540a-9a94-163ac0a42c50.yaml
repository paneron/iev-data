  definition: operation performed on a set for which a commutative multiplication
    is defined, the result of which, for elements stem:[a] and stem:[b] of the set,
    is the unique element stem:[q], if it exists in the set, such that stem:[b * q
    = a]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Division is defined for rational numbers and extended to other classes of numbers,
    except the division by zero, and to mathematical entities such as polynomials,
    and also to quantities and units.
  - In a division stem:[a // b], the first element stem:[a] is called "dividend" and
    the second is called "divisor".
  - The division of entities stem:[a] and stem:[b] is expressed by the words "stem:[a]
    divided by stem:[b]" or "stem:[a] by stem:[b]" and denoted by stem:[(a)/(b)],
    stem:[a // b] or stem:[a b^(- 1)].
