  definition: complex number obtained from a given complex number by replacing the
    imaginary part by its negative
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The conjugate of the complex number stem:[c = a + j b = | c | e^(j phi)] is stem:[c
    * = a - j b = | c | e^(- j phi)]. In mathematics, the conjugate of stem:[c] is
    often denoted by stem:[bar c].
  - The concept of conjugate may be applied to complex scalar, vector or tensor quantities
    or to matrices of complex elements.
