  definition: ratio of resistance at room temperature to the residual resistance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The room temperature is usually selected from 273 K, 293 K, 295 K, or 300 K.
  - 'The residual resistance for a superconducting wire or composite: the resistance
    just above the critical temperature is adopted as a residual resistance.'
