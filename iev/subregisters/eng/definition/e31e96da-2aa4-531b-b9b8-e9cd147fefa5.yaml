  definition: function for which both the argument and the value are functions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An example of transformation is the Fourier transformation, where the argument
    is a function of time and the value is the Fourier transform of this function.
    When the argument, the value, or both, are ordered set of entities, a linear transformation
    is often represented by a matrix.
  - For historical reasons, some transformations are called operators, e.g. nabla
    operator (IEC 60050-102, {{102-05-18, IEV:102-05-18}}).
