  definition: the limit of the natural logarithm of the ratio of values at a given
    frequency of a specified component of an electromagnetic field at two points aligned
    in the direction of propagation of a guided or plane wave or of a wave practically
    plane in a limited space domain divided by the distance between the two points
    when this distance tends to zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The propagation coefficient is a complex quantity usually a function of frequency
    and has the dimension of reciprocal length.
