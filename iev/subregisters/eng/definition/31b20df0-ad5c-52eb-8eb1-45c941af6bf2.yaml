  definition: link between clearly identifiable physical objects (things) and services
    and a virtual representation in an internet-like structure

  notes:
  - The internet of things and services no longer consists only of human participants
    but also of things.
  - The objective of the internet of things and services is to minimize the information
    gap between the real world and the virtual world. An important step towards this
    objective is the standardization of components and services in the internet of
    things and services.
