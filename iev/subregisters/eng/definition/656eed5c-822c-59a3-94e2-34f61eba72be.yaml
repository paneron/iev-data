  definition: energy of electromagnetic waves weighted by the <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral
    luminous efficiency</a> multiplied by maximum luminous efficacy of a specified
    photometric condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Luminous energy for photopic vision is expressed by


    stem:[Q_v = K_m int_0^(oo) Q_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[Q]~e,stem:[λ]~(stem:[λ]) is the spectral radiant energy at wavelength
    stem:[λ], stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is spectral luminous efficiency, and stem:[K]~m~
    is maximum luminous efficacy.'
  - The term "quantity of light" is no longer used.
  - Luminous energy can be emitted, transferred or received.
  - 'Luminous energy can be expressed by the time integral of the luminous flux, stem:[Φ]~v~,
    over a given duration, Δstem:[t]:


    stem:[Q_v = int_((Delta t)) Phi_v d t]'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant energy". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon energy".
  - The luminous energy is expressed in lumen second (lm·s) or lumen hour (lm·h).
