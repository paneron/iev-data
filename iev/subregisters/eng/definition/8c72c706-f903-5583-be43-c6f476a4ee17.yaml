    which has met divergence effects, divided by the amplitude of a wave which would
    have existed at the same point without these effects

  notes:
  - When the specified wave is a wave reflected by a curved surface, the corresponding
    factor may be considered as a factor which multiplies the reflection factor of
    the reflecting surface, assumed to be flat.
