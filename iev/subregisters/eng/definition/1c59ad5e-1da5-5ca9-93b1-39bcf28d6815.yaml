  definition: combination of two {{transmission channels, IEV:701-02-01}} permitting
    {{transmission, IEV:701-01-03}} in both directions between two points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the {{telecommunication, IEV:701-01-05}} is by nature {{unidirectional, IEV:701-03-18}},
    e.g. long-distance {{television, IEV:701-01-15}} transmission, the term “circuit”
    is sometimes used to designate the single transmission channel providing the facility,
    but this usage is deprecated.
  - In some countries the term “communication channel” or its abbreviation “channel”
    is used to mean “telecommunication circuit”, i.e. to encompass the two directions
    of transmission. This usage is deprecated.
  - The adjective "telecommunication" can be replaced by an adjective indicating the
    nature or characteristics of the transmitted {{signals, IEV:101-12-02}}; for example,
    {{telephone circuit, IEV:722-06-07}}, {{telegraph circuit, IEV:721-11-04}}, {{data
    circuit, IEV:721-11-05}}, digital circuit.
  - Characteristics of the transmission channels such as {{frequency bandwidth, IEV:702-01-03}},
    or {{digit rate, IEV:702-05-23}}, can be different in the two directions of transmission.
  - In telephony, usage of the term “telephone circuit” is generally limited to a
    telecommunication circuit directly connecting two {{switching centres, IEV:722-06-05}}.
  - 'In switching, the two transmission channels associated in a telecommunication
    circuit can be: a) permanently associated together; b) selected from separate
    sets for association together throughout a {{call, IEV:701-03-05}}; c) selected
    from time to time during a call and then released, the selection and release processes
    being determined, separately in the two directions, by the varying characteristics
    of the information being transmitted over the telecommunication circuit.'
