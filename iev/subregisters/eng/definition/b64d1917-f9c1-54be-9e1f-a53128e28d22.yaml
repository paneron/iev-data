  definition: electromagnetic wave filter fabricated from superconductors used in
    the typical frequency range of 300 MHz to 30 GHz
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Because superconducting filter shows very little insertion loss, multiple-pole
    filters can be fabricated with both very high frequency selectivity and very little
    insertion loss.
