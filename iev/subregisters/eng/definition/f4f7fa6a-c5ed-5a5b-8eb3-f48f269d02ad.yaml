  definition: 'a graded index profile with the square of refractive index in the core
    decreasing according to a law involving a power of the distance from the axis.


    stem:[n]^2^ (stem:[r]) = stem:[n]^2^~1~ [1 – 2 Δ (stem:[r] / stem:[а])^g^]


    stem:[r] ≤ stem:[a] where :


    stem:[n](stem:[r]) is the refractive index as a function of radius,


    stem:[n]~1~ is the refractive index on axis,


    stem:[a] is the core radius,


    stem:[g] is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile


    and Δ is a parameter which is the same as the refractive index contrast when the
    refractive index of the cladding is constant'
