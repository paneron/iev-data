  definition: for two sinusoidal quantities of the same frequency in a given order,
    difference between their initial phases with possible addition of a multiple of
    2π so that the difference is greater than −π and not greater than π
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For the quantities stem:[a^( ' ) ( t ) = hat A^( ' ) cos ( omega t + vartheta^(
    ' )_0 )] and stem:[a^( ″ ) ( t ) = hat A^( ″ ) cos ( omega t + vartheta^( ″ )_0
    )], the phase difference is stem:[varphi = vartheta^( ″ )_0 - vartheta^( ' )_0
    + 2 pi n], where stem:[n] is an integer, chosen so that stem:[- pi varphi &lt;=
    pi].
