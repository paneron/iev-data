  definition: 'an evacuated tubular structure with two or more electrodes that are
    insulated from each other: a cathode from which electrons are emitted; an anode
    at which the deceleration of the electrons causes the emission of X-radiation
    and, in some cases, one or more pierced electrodes between the cathode and anode
    to accelerate, to focus, or to control the electron beam'
