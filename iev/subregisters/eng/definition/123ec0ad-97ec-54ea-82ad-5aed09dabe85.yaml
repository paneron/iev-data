  definition: '{{group delay, IEV:702-02-20}} of the significant {{spectral components,
    IEV:702-04-41}} of a {{signal, IEV:101-12-02}} assuming that this delay is substantially
    the same for all these significant components'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept of envelope delay is meaningful only if the {{amplitude, IEV:702-04-54}}
    of the signal is relatively undistorted by the transmission medium.
