      modification: The wording of the definition is slightly different and several
        notes to entry have been added to adapt to usage in control technology.
      type: modified
  definition: for a quantity growing or decaying exponentially towards a constant
    value the duration of a time interval, at the end of which the absolute value
    of the difference between that constant value and the value of the variable quantity
    has decreased to e^–1^ times of the absolute value of the difference at the beginning
    of the interval, where e is the base of natural logarithms
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The time constant is the variable quantity stem:[τ] appearing in the function
    stem:[F ( t ) = a + b * e^(- (t)/(tau))] describing a time-dependent variable
    quantity.
  - 'The time constant is the reciprocal of the damping coefficient stem:[δ] (IEC
    60027-6, _Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 6: Control
    technology_) of a damped oscillation, as well.'
  - In control technology the time constant usually is derived from the step response
    of a first-order lag element as the duration of the time interval, required to
    reach 63,2 % [i.e. (1 – e^–1^)-times] of the steady-state value of the step response.
  - The time constant is the variable quantity stem:[τ] appearing in the expression
    stem:[F ( t ) = a + b * e^(- (t)/(tau)) * f ( t )] of an exponentially damped
    oscillation, where stem:[f](stem:[t]) is a sinusoidal function.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-24 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
