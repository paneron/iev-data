  definition: quotient of five times the sum of the area of the walls bounded by the
    ceiling and the plane of the luminaires and the sum of the areas of the ceiling
    and the plane of the luminaires, used in the calculation of the utilization factor
    or utilance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The ceiling cavity ratio is given by the formula


    stem:[K_c = ((5 h_c ( a + b )))/((a b))]


    where stem:[a] and stem:[b] are the dimensions of the sides of the room and stem:[h]~c~
    is the distance from the ceiling to the plane of the luminaires.'
