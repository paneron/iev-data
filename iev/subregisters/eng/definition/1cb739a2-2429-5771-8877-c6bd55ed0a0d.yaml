  definition: circuit-theory theorem stating that, for two networks with the same
    number of branches and identical interconnections, the algebraic sum of the products,
    for all branches, of the voltage at the terminals of a branch of one network and
    the current in the corresponding branch of the other network is zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The polarity of each branch voltage in the first network relative to the reference
    direction of current in the corresponding branch of the second network has to
    be chosen uniformly throughout the two networks.
  - When the two networks represent the voltage and current distributions in the same
    network at the same instant, Tellegen theorem expresses the conservation of power.
