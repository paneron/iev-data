  definition: 'detectivity, stem:[D], normalized to take into account two important
    parameters of the detection system, the sensitive area, stem:[A], of the detector
    and the measurement bandwidth, Δstem:[f]


    stem:[D * = D ( A Delta f )^(1 // 2) = Phi_m^(- 1) ( A Delta f )^(1 // 2)]


    where stem:[Φ]~m~ is noise equivalent power'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept "normalized detectivity" is realistic only if the responsivity and
    noise output of the detector are {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} independent throughout
    the frequency range under consideration and if the noise equivalent input varies
    as the square root of the detector area; this is not always the case.
  - The normalized detectivity is expressed in metre hertz to the power one half per
    watt (m·Hz^1/2^·W^−1^).
