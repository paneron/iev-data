data:
  definition: an ionization chamber in which the radiation beam is determined by a
    diaphragm in such a way that the volume of air irradiated is accurately determined
    and that neither the beam nor electrons produced within the beam impinge upon
    the electrodes. It is mainly used for absolute measurements of exposure
