  definition: irradiation of reflecting materials at 45° to the normal, from all azimuthal
    directions, simultaneously
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In measuring the colours of reflecting samples by irradiating with the forty-five
    degree annular geometry, the effects of texture and directionality are minimized.
    The forty-five degree annular geometry can be achieved by the use of a small source
    and an elliptic ring reflector or other aspheric optics.
  - Forty-five degree annular geometry is sometimes approximated by the use of a number
    of sources in a ring or a number of fibre bundles illuminated by a single source
    and terminated in a ring. Such an approximation to annular geometry is called
    "circumferential geometry", with notation "45°c".
