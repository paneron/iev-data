  definition: for a radionuclide, time elapsed when the number of atoms or {{atomic
    nuclei, IEV:113-05-21}} in the considered state has decreased by a factor 1/e
    from its initial value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a radionuclide the radioactive mean life is the reciprocal of the decay constant
    stem:[λ], (stem:[τ] = 1/ stem:[λ]).
