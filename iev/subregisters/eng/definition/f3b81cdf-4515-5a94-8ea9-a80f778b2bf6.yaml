  definition: 'multi-postion element the output variable of which may assume one of
    two discrete values


    SEE: Figure 19.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The change of the output variable can occur at a pair of switching values, that
    is at different values of the input variable depending on direction of change;
    the difference in these values is called the differential gap (see 351-50-25).
  - This entry was numbered 351-28-32 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
