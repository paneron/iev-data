  definition: 'for a capacitive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, quotient
    of the electric charge stem:[q] at A by the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}})
    stem:[u]~AB~ between the terminals


    stem:[C = (q)/((u_((AB))))]


    where the sign of the electric charge is determined by taking the electric current
    in the time integral defining this charge as positive if its direction is from
    A to B and negative if its direction is from B to A'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A capacitance cannot be negative.
  - The coherent SI unit of capacitance is farad, F.
