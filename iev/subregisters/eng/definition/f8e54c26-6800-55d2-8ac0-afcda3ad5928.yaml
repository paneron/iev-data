  definition: 'for a resistive two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, derivative of the electric current i in the element or circuit with respect
    to the voltage u~AB~ ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals:


    stem:[G_d = ((d i))/((d u_((AB))))]


    where the electric current is taken as positive if its direction is from A to
    B and negative in the opposite case'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an ideal resistor, the differential conductance G~d~ is equal to its conductance
    G.
