  definition: optical device that modifies a beam of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical
    radiation</a> to produce a beam with a unique state of polarization irrespective
    of the state of polarization of the incident radiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A polarizer is called a linear, circular or elliptical polarizer depending on
    the state of polarization produced.
  - The unqualified term "polarizer" is frequently used to describe a linear polarizer.
  - A distinction is made between a perfect polarizer that transmits only a unique
    state of polarization and an imperfect polarizer that, in addition to transmitting
    a unique state of polarization, does not completely exclude all other polarization
    states.
