  definition: line, surface or volume integral of a quantity associated with an electromagnetic
    field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Quantities associated with electromagnetic field are for example: electric field
    strength, electric flux density, magnetic field strength, magnetic flux density,
    volumic electric charge, electric current density, magnetic vector potential.
    Integral quantities are for example: voltage (electric tension), electric current,
    electric charge, magnetic flux, magnetic tension, linked flux.'
  - Line, surface and volume integrals are defined in IEC 60050-101.
