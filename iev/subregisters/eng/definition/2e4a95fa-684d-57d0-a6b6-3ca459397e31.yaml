    respect to area at a point on a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[H_v = ((d Q_v))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Q]~v~ is luminous energy and stem:[A] is the area on which the luminous
    energy is incident'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "light exposure" is no longer used.
  - 'Luminous exposure can be derived from the spectral radiant exposure distribution
    by


    stem:[H_v \ = \ K_m int_0^(oo) H_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[H]~e,~stem:[λ](stem:[λ])
    is the spectral radiant exposure at wavelength stem:[λ] and stem:[V](stem:[λ])
    is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>. Integral limits can
    be confined depending on the spectral <a href="IEV845-25-061">responsivity</a>
    of the detectors used as a sensor.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exposure". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exposure"
  - The luminous exposure is expressed in lux second (lx·s = lm·s·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-43 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
