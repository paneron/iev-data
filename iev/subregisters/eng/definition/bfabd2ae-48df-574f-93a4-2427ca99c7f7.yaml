  definition: '{{transmission channel, IEV:701-02-01}}  in a {{telecommunication circuit,
    IEV:701-02-03}} that handles {{signals, IEV:101-12-02}} arriving at a given point'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The qualification of a channel as, for example, "go" or "return" is usually highly
    localized. A channel referred to as a {{go channel, IEV:704-04-04}} at one point
    in a network could be referred to as a return channel at another point.
  - In telephony, the English qualifiers “return” and “receive” can be synonymous.
    In certain applications, for example in television reception, only the receive
    channel will exist. In this case, the use of the term “return channel” is not
    applicable.
