data:
  definition: the difference in phase between the primary and secondary currents (or
    voltages), the positive direction of the primary and secondary currents (or voltages)
    being so chosen that this difference is zero for a perfect transformer
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The phase displacement is said to be positive when the secondary current (voltage)
    leads the primary current.
