  definition: cloudy appearance due to contrast reduction, usually attributable to
    light scattering
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Correlated measures in reflection are:<ol type="a">. scattering of light at the
    glossy surface of a specimen responsible for the apparent reduction in contrast
    of objects viewed by reflection at the surface;. percentage of reflected light
    scattered by a specimen having a glossy surface so that its direction deviates
    more than a specified angle from the direction of specular reflection.
  - Correlated measures in transmission are:<ol type="a">. scattering of light by
    a specimen responsible for the apparent reduction in contrast of objects viewed
    through it;. percentage of transmitted light that is scattered so that its direction
    deviates more than a specified angle from the direction of the incident beam.
