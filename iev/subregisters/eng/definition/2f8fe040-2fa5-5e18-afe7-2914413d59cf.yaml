  definition: '{{binary digit rate, IEV:704-16-07}} equivalent to a {{transfer rate,
    IEV:171-06-03}} for specified {{data elements, IEV:171-02-01}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The data signalling rate is the minimum value of the binary digit rate strictly
    necessary to convey the same information in the same duration as a given digital
    signal at a given transfer rate.
  - The data signalling rate in parallel transmission is given by stem:[sum_((i =
    1))^m (1)/((T_i)) (log)_2 n_i], where stem:[m] is the number of parallel transmission
    channels, stem:[Ti] is the duration of the significant interval for the stem:[i]-th
    channel, stem:[ni] is the number of significant conditions in the stem:[i]-th
    channel.
  - The unit of data signalling rate is the bit per second (bit/s).
