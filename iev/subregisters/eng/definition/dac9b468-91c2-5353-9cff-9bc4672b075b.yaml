  definition: ideal observer having a relative spectral responsivity curve that conforms
    to the <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a> function for photopic
    vision, stem:[V](stem:[λ]), or to the function for scotopic vision, stem:[V]′(stem:[λ]),
    and that complies with the summation law implied in the definition of luminous
    flux
