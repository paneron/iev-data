data:
  definition: angle between two imaginary lines in a plane through the optical beam
    axis, such that these lines pass through the centre of the front face of the device
    and through points at which the luminous intensity is 50 % of the centre beam
    intensity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The beam angle is a full angle measure, not a half angle measure.
  - The beam angle is expressed in degree (Â°).
