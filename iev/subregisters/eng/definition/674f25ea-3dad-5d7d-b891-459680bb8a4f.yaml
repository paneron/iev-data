  definition: file format and encoding used to store transforms that relate one colour
    encoding with another, in a form defined by the International Color Consortium
    (ICC)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For example, the ICC file format can be used to store the transforms used to convert
    device colour image data to colorimetrically equivalent colour image data, encoded
    in one of the ICC profile connection colour spaces, as part of a colour management
    system. The ICC file format specifies a number of transforms to be in each ICC
    profile file.
