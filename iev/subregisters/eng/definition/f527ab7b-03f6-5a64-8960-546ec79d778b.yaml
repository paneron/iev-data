data:
  definition: quotient of the vertical optical thickness of a turbid atmosphere and
    the vertical optical thickness of the pure and dry atmosphere (Rayleigh atmosphere),
    related to the whole solar spectrum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The total turbidity factor can be expressed by


    stem:[T]~L~ = (stem:[δ]~R~ + stem:[δ]~A~ + stem:[δ]~Z~ + stem:[δ]~W~) / stem:[δ]~R~


    ~


    where~ stem:[δ]~R~ is the optical thickness with respect to Rayleigh scattering
    at the air molecules, and stem:[δ]~A~, stem:[δ]~Z~, stem:[δ]~W~ are the optical
    thicknesses with respect to Mie scattering and absorption at the aerosol particles,
    to ozone absorption, and to water vapour absorption respectively.'
  - The total turbidity factor has unit one.
