  examples: []
  notes:
  - Exposure limits for human safety of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>,
    stem:[H]~L~, are normally recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
    Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
  - Exposure limits are often based on irradiance (e.g. for the skin), but where relevant,
    can also be based on radiance (e.g. the blue light hazard of extended sources).
