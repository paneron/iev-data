  definition: the maximum active power that can be theoretically delivered at a given
    frequency by a source having an impedance of positive real part to a directly
    connected load when the impedance of the load is widely varied
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The available power is obtained when the resistance of the load is equal to that
    of the source and its reactance is equal in magnitude but of opposite sign.
  - In some cases, conditions such as overheating or overvoltage prevent the available
    power from being obtained.
