  definition: '{{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} {{unit, IEV:112-01-14}} of {{electric current,
    IEV:121-11-13}}, equal to the electric current corresponding to the flow of (1/1,602 176 634) × 10^19^
    {{elementary electric charges, IEV:113-05-16}} per {{second, IEV:112-02-04}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of
    electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary
    charge stem:[e] to be 1,602 176 634 × 10^−19^ when expressed in the unit C, which
    is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of Δstem:[ν]~Cs~."'
  - 'The definition of the ampere in IEV 112-02-07:2010-01 was: "SI unit of electric
    current, equal to the direct current which, if maintained constant in two straight
    parallel conductors of infinite length, of circular cross-section with negligible
    area, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors
    a force per length equal to 2 × 10^−7^ N/m".


    Note 3  to entry: The new definition of the ampere fixes the value of the elementary
    charge stem:[e] instead of that of the magnetic constant, stem:[μ]~0~. As a consequence,
    the value of stem:[μ]~0~ has to be determined experimentally.'
  - 'The ampere is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: {{second, IEV:112-02-04}}
    (s), {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}} (m), {{kilogram, IEV:112-02-06}} (kg), ampere (A),
    {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), {{mole, IEV:112-02-09}} (mol) and {{candela, IEV:112-02-10}}
    (cd).'
