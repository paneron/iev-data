  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[D] by dstem:[t], where dstem:[D] is the increment
    of absorbed dose in time interval dstem:[D]


    stem:[overset(˙)(D) = ((d D))/((d t))]'

  notes:
  - "The SI unit of absorbed dose rate is joule per kilogram and second, whose special\
    \ name is gray per second. The earlier special unit of absorbed dose rate, still\
    \ in temporary\r\nuse, was the rad per second.\n\n1 Gy • s = 100 rad • s^−1^ =\
    \ 1 J kg ^−1^ • s^−1^"
