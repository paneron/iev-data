  definition: 'quantity defined by


    stem:[Phi = K_m int_0^(oo) V ( lambda ) P ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where:


    stem:[P](stem:[λ]) is the power spectral density radiated by the source at wavelength
    stem:[λ];


    stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is the spectral luminous efficiency for photopic vision;


    stem:[K]~m~ is a constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the SI system of units, where stem:[P](stem:[λ]) is expressed in watts per
    metre, the luminous flux stem:[Ф] is expressed in lumens, and stem:[K]~m~ = 683
    lm/W.
