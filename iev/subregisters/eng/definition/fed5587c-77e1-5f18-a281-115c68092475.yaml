  definition: number stem:[k] in the expression stem:[vartheta_0 - 2 pi ((( i - 1
    ) k))/(m)] for the initial phase of quantity number stem:[i] of the set of stem:[m]
    quantities forming a symmetric polyphase system, where stem:[vartheta_0] is the
    initial phase of one of the quantities which is arbitrarily chosen out of the
    set of stem:[m] quantities, stem:[i] is one of the integers 1, 2, ..., stem:[m],
    and stem:[k] is a characteristic of the system, equal to one of the integers 0,
    1, 2, ..., stem:[m] âˆ’ 1
