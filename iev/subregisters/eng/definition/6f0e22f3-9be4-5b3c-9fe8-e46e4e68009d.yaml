  definition: conductor to transport electric current from room temperature to a device
    at cryogenic temperature
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Vapour enthalpy cooled leads: current leads containing flow passages along the
    length by which the enthalpy of the boiled-off gas from the cryostat is utilized
    to decrease the heat flux into the coolant and device in the cryostat.'
