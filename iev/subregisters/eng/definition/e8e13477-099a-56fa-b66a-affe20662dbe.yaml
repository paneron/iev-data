data:
  definition: for a radio wave transmitted with a given polarization, the ratio at
    the reception point of the power received with the expected polarization to the
    power received with the orthogonal polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The cross polarization discrimination depends both on the characteristics of the
    antennas and on the propagation medium.
