  definition: tensor of the second order defined by a bilinear form such that stem:[f
    ( U , V ) = - f ( V , U )]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The components of an antisymmetric tensor are such that stem:[T_((i j)) = - T_((j
    i))], and in particular stem:[T_((i i)) = 0].
  - 'An antisymmetric tensor defined on a three-dimensional space has three strict
    components which can be considered as the coordinates stem:[W_1 , W_2 , W_3] of
    an axial vector:


    stem:[( [[0,W_3,- W_2],[- W_3,0,W_1],[W_2,- W_1,0]] )]


    The axial vector associated with the antisymmetric tensor stem:[U ox V - V ox
    U] is the vector product of the two vectors.'
