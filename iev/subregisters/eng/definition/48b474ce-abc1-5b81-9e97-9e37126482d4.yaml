  definition: ratio of recovered heat flow of a {{fuel cell power system, IEV:485-09-01}}
    to the total enthalpy flow supplied to the fuel cell power system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - â€ƒThe supplied total (including reaction enthalpy) enthalpy flow of the {{raw fuel,
    IEV:485-07-01}} should be related to the lower heating value (LHV) for a better
    comparison with other types of energy conversion system.
