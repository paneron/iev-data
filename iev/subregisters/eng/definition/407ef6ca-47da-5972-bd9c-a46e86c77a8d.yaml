  definition: colour space defined by the characteristics of a real or idealized imaging
    device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Device-dependent colour spaces having a simple functional relationship to CIE
    colorimetry can also be categorized as colorimetric colour spaces. For example,
    additive RGB colour spaces corresponding to real or idealized cathode ray tube
    (CRT) displays can be treated as colorimetric colour spaces.
