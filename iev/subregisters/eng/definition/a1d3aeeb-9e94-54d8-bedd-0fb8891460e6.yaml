  definition: 'density of luminous flux with respect to solid angle in a specified
    direction


    stem:[I_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d omega))]


    where stem:[Φ]~v~ is the luminous flux emitted in a specified direction, and stem:[Ω]
    is the solid angle containing that direction'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For practical realization of the quantity, the source is approximated by a <a
    href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>.
  - 'The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]), is used to determine
    the luminous flux, stem:[Φ]~v~, within a certain solid angle, stem:[Ω], of a source:


    stem:[Phi_v = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_v ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi
    \ d vartheta].'
  - 'Luminous intensity can be derived from the spectral radiant intensity distribution
    by


    stem:[I_v = \ K_m int_0^(oo) I_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[I]~e,stem:[λ]~(stem:[λ])
    is the spectral radiant intensity at wavelength stem:[λ], and stem:[V](stem:[λ])
    is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant intensity". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon intensity".
  - The luminous intensity is expressed in candela (cd = lm·sr^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-31 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
