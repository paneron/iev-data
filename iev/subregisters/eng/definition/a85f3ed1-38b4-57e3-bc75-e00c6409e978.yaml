  definition: 'quotient of the coefficient of luminous intensity, stem:[R], of a plane
    retroreflective surface and its area, stem:[A]


    stem:[R_A = (R)/(A) = ((I // E_( _|_ )))/(A)]


    where stem:[I] is the luminous intensity of the retroreflector in the direction
    of observation, and stem:[E_( _|_ )] is the illuminance at the retroreflector
    on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident light'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coefficient of retroreflection is particularly suitable for describing materials
    in sheet form.
  - Formerly, the symbol stem:[R]′ was used for this quantity.
  - The coefficient of retroreflection is expressed in candela per lux per square
    metre (cd·lx^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-97 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
