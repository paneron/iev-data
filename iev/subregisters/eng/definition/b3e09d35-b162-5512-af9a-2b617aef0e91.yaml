  definition: quotient of that part of the illuminance at a point on a given plane
    which is received directly (or through clear glass) from a sky of assumed or known

    hemisphere of this sky, where the contribution of direct sunlight to both illuminances
    is excluded
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When calculating the lighting of interiors, the contribution of direct sunlight
    has to be considered separately.
