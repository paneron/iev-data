  definition: use of a {{product, IEV:902-02-03}}, including its transport and storage,
    or a process, in accordance with the provided information for use or, in the absence
    of such, in accordance with generally understood patterns of usage
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Normal use should not be confused with {{intended use, IEV:871-04-17}}. While
    both include the concept of use as intended by the manufacturer, intended use
    focuses on the purpose while normal use incorporates not only the purpose, but
    transport and storage as well.
