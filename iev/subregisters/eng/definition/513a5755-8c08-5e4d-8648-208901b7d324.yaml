  definition: the amplitude of the fundamental component of the output signal of a
    two-port device as a function of the frequency of a sinusoidal input signal of
    specified amplitude
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of a linear time-invariant two-port device the amplitude/ frequency
    characteristic is represented by the modulus of the frequency response.
  - The frequency of the fundamental component of the output signal may differ from
    the input frequency.
