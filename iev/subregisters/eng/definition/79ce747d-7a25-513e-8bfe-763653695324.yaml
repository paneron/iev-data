  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the radiation intensity
    produced by an antenna in a given direction to the radiation intensity that would
    be obtained if the power accepted by the antenna were radiated equally in all
    directions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - When the absolute gain is expressed in decibels, the notation dBi is recommended
    by the International Telecommunication Union as a unit symbol.
  - The radiation intensity from an antenna in a given direction is the power radiated
    per unit solid angle.
