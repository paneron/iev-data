  definition: set of interrelated elements considered in a defined context as a whole
    and separated from their environment
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A system is generally defined with the view of achieving a given objective, e.g.
    by performing a definite function.
  - Elements of a system can be natural or man-made material objects, as well as modes
    of thinking and the results thereof (e.g. forms of organisation, mathematical
    methods, programming languages).
  - The system is considered to be separated from the environment and the other external
    systems by an imaginary surface, which cuts the links between them and the system.
  - The term "system" should be qualified when it is not clear from the context to
    what it refers, e.g. control system, colorimetric system, system of units, transmission
    system.
