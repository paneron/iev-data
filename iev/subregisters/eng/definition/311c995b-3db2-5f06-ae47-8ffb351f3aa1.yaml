data:
  definition: voltage pulse of a specified shape applied during dielectric tests with
    a virtual front duration of the order of 1 μs and a time to half value of the
    order of 50 μs
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The lightning impulse is defined by the two figures giving these durations in
    microseconds; in particular the standard lightning impulse is 1,2/50 μs.
