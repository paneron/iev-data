  definition: vector quantity *stem:[v]* = d*stem:[r]*/dstem:[t], where *stem:[r]*
    is position vector and stem:[t] is time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The velocity is related to a point described by its position vector. The point
    may localize a particle, or be attached to any other object such as a body or
    a wave.
  - '2 The velocity depends on the choice of the reference frame. Proper transformation
    between frames must be used: Galilean for non-relativistic description, Lorentzian
    for relativistic description.'
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of velocity is metre per second, m/s.
