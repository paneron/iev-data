  definition: 'of a material saturated by a magnetostatic field, the complex permeability
    when it is subjected to a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in the direction
    of, and having an stem:[vec H] -field component perpendicular to, the magnetostatic
    field strength:


    stem:[underset(_)(mu)_( _|_ ) = ((underset(_)(mu)_r^2 - underset(_)(kappa)_r^2))/(((underset(_)(mu))_r))]


    where stem:[μ]~r~ and stem:[κ]~r~ are components of Polder''s tensor permeability'
