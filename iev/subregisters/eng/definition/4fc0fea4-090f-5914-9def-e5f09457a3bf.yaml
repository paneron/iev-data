  definition: radio reception method in which one resultant signal is obtained from
    several received signals which convey the same information but for which the radio
    path or the transmission channel differs by at least one characteristic such as
    frequency, polarization, or the position or orientation of antennas
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quality of the resultant signal can be higher than that of the individual
    signals, due to the partial decorrelation of propagation conditions at a given
    instant over the different radio paths or transmission channels.
