data:
  definition: a method of source coding using the difference between the value of
    a sample and a predicted value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For signals having strong correlation between successive samples, a reduction
    of bit rate can be attained by differential coding, since fewer quantization intervals
    may be used to quantize differences than would be required for quantizing sample
    values with comparable precision.
