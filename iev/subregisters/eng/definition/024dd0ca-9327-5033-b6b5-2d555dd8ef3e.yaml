  notes:
  - "The reference plane may be one of the following types:\n\n. for clamped measurements,\
    \ the flat chuck surface that contacts the back surface of the wafer; \n\n. three\
    \ points at specified locations on the front surface within the fixed quality\
    \ area; \n\n. the least-squares fit to the front surface using all measured points\
    \ within the fixed quality area; \n\n. the least-squares fit to the front surface\
    \ using all measured points within one site. "
