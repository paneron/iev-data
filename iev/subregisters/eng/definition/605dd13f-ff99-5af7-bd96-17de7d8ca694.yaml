  definition: technique of {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} materials by heating them to
    below their melting points and pressing them together to achieve solid state adherence
    by the mutual diffusion of their atoms
  examples: []
  notes:
  - As the materials are bonded in a solid state, far more accurate bonding is possible
    than with fusion bonding. Diffusion bonding is mainly used for bonding metals
    or bonding a ceramic to a metal. After bonding dissimilar materials, thermal stress
    occurs during cooling because of the difference in the coefficients of the thermal
    expansion of the materials. To avoid cracking caused by this stress, most diffusion
    bonding research is concerned with ways of reducing thermal stress. Methods of
    achieving this include sandwiching either a third material with a coefficient
    of thermal expansion roughly halfway between that of the two bonding materials,
    or a readily deformable material between them. Much research is being done into
    the insertion of a material whose coefficient of thermal expansion changes gradually
    across its thickness (functionally gradient material, i.e. FGM).
