  definition: <a href="IEV845-27-018">electric discharge</a> in which the secondary
    emission from the cathode is much greater than the thermionic emission
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The glow discharge is characterized by a considerable cathode fall (typically
    70 V or more) and by low current density at the cathode (some 10 A·m^−2^).
