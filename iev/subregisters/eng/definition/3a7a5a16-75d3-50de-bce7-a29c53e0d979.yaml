  definition: "functional unit with two inputs and one output the value of the output\
    \ variable of which is equal to the quotient of the value of the first input variable\
    \ multiplied by a constant weighting factor to the second input variable multiplied\
    \ by a constant weighting factor according to the formula\n\nstem:[v ( t ) = K_0\
    \ * ((K_1 * u_1 ( t )))/((K_2 * u_2 ( t )))]\n\nwhere<table>\r\n<tr>\n<td>stem:[t]</td>\n\
