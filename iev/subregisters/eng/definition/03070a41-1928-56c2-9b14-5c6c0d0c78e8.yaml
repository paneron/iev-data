  definition: ratio between the change of the controlled variable with closed-loop
    control and its change without control in case of changing of the reference variable
    or a disturbance variable under given conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In case of sinusoidal input variables the complex control factor is the quotient
    of the phasors of these values as function of the angular frequency.
  - In case of stepwise changing of input variables the real control factor is the
    quotient of these values after the end of the transient processes. If there are
    one or more integral elements in the forward path the value of the real control
    factor is zero.
  - 'In closed-loop control with proportional behaviour of the open loop the real
    control factor is given by


    stem:[R = (1)/((1 + K_0))] where stem:[K]~0~ is the loop gain.'
