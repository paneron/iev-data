  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between, and the sum
    of, the magnetic losses stem:[P]~90~ , measured perpendicular to, and stem:[P]~0~,
    measured parallel to the direction of rolling, the ratio being expressed as a
    percentage:


    stem:[T = ((P_((90)) - P_0))/((P_((90)) + P_0)) xx 100 %]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The measurements of stem:[P]~90~ and stem:[P]~0~ are to be made under the same
    conditions.
