  definition: '{{factor, IEV:112-03-04}} usually expressed as a percentage or any
    decimal fraction such as thousandth or millionth'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The use of "rate" with this meaning is often deprecated in favour of "ratio".
    For example, it is recommended to use “error ratio” and not "error rate" (see
    {{IEV 702-07-39, IEV:702-07-39}}). In other examples, "factor" is used in English
    for "taux" in French: {{total harmonic factor, IEV:103-07-32}}, {{modulation factor,
    IEV:702-06-19}}.'
