data:
  definition: at a point in a medium, velocity of the envelope of a packet of superimposed
    sinusoidal waves of equal amplitude and slightly different frequencies tending
    to a common limiting frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The magnitude of the group velocity vector is equal to the derivative of the frequency
    with respect to the wavenumber.
  - If both group velocities and other velocities are involved, then stem:[c] should
    be used for the former and stem:[v] (vee) for the latter.
