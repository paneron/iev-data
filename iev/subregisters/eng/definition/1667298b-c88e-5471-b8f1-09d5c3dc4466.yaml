  definition: 'physical constant used to express the magnetic moment of an electron


    stem:[e h]/4stem:[ π m] ≈ (9,274 078 ± 0,000 036) x 10^−24^ Am^2^


    where stem:[e] is the elementary charge, stem:[h] the Planck''s constant, and
    stem:[m] the electron rest mass'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The numerical value quoted is that adopted by the International Union of Pure
    and Applied Physics (IUPAP).
  - The magnetic moment of a free electron due to its spin is approximately equal
    to 1,001stem:[μ]~B~.
