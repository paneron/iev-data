  definition: an electron accelerator in which the electrons are guided in circular
    orbits tangential to each other (at one point) and of increasing radii under the
    influence of a constant magnetic field; they are accelerated at the beginning
    of each orbit by traversing a cavity resonator in which there is a radio-frequency
    electric field
