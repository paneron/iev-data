data:
  definition: 'relative amplitude of the periodic fluctuation of the luminous flux
    as calculated by the ratio of the difference between the maximum and the minimum
    instantaneous luminous flux, stem:[Φ]~max~ and stem:[Φ]~min~ respectively, to
    the sum of both of these values:


    stem:[((Phi_((max)) - Phi_((min))))/((Phi_((max)) + Phi_((min))))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The amplitude of fluctuation can be applied also for "luminance" and "illuminance".
    Additional photometric quantities can be used.
  - The amplitude of fluctuation of the luminous flux has unit one and is usually
    expressed in per cent (%).
