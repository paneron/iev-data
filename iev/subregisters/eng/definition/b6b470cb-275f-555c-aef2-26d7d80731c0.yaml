  definition: "duration stem:[t]~SU~ between the application of the supply voltage\
    \ to the oscillator and the time when the RF output signal of desired frequency\
    \ controlled by the quartz resonator fulfils the following specified conditions:\n\
    \n. for quasi-sinusoidal waveforms, the signal envelope is 90 % of the steady-state\
    \ peak-to-peak amplitude; \n\n. for pulse waveforms, the output pulse sequence\
    \ is periodical near the steady-state frequency while its low level stem:[V]~LO~\
    \ remains below stem:[V]~OL~ and its high level stem:[V]~HI~ exceeds stem:[V]~OH~\
    \ permanently, where stem:[V]~OH~ and stem:[V]~OL~ are defined by the applicable\
    \ logic family"
