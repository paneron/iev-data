  definition: '1) a wave, which appears beyond a surface separating two different
    media when an incident wave meets the surface, which propagates away from the
    surface, generally in a different direction, and which is interpretable by geometrical
    optics


    2) a wave which propagates in a medium with properties varying continuously in
    space and which is interpretable by geometrical optics'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the first case but not in the second one, the refracted wave is associated
    with a reflected wave.
