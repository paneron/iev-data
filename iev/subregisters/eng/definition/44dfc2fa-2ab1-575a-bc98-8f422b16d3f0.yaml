  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the magnetic field
    strength stem:[*H*]  in a medium is equal to the magnetic flux density stem:[*B*]
    :


    stem:[*B*] = stem:[Î¼] stem:[*H*]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium the absolute permeability is a scalar; for an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
