  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing heat conduction, defined by stem:[F
    o = ((lambda t))/((c_p rho l^2)) = ((alpha t))/((l^2))], where stem:[λ] is thermal
    conductivity, stem:[t] is duration, stem:[c]~stem:[p]~ is specific heat capacity
    at constant pressure, stem:[ρ] is mass density, stem:[l] is a specified length,
    and stem:[α] is thermal diffusivity
