  definition: equipment used to prevent unsafe operation, protect personnel, and prevent
    hazards
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Interlocks may be single-channel, double channel or multi-channel.
  - Single-channel interlocks use a single channel of sensors, logic units and an
    actuation item such as a contactor or relay.
  - Double-channel interlocks use two channels of equipment and sensors, arranged
    so that each channel is capable, on its own, of preventing the unsafe condition
    or state. The channels may consist of two sets of essentially identical equipment.
    An alternative is two different channels which perform the interlock functions
    differently, or two similar channels, one in normal operation and the other in
    backup operation to prevent an unsafe condition or state if the first channel
    fails.
  - Multi-channel interlocks use several channels of equipment and sensors. They are
    arranged so that each channel is capable, on its own, of preventing the unsafe
    condition or state. One failed channel cannot block actions which prevent unsafe
    conditions or states. Use of multi-channel systems can provide benefits such as
    allowing on-line maintenance and avoiding the need for a channel bypass.
