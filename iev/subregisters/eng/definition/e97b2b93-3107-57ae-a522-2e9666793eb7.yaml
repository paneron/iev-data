  definition: in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, vector normal to a given surface
    at a given point, the magnitude of which is the scalar surface element at the
    given point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the space orientation is defined by a right-handed trihedron, the direction
    of the vector surface element defines the orientation of the surface at that point
    as being in the anti-clockwise direction for an observer looking in the direction
    opposite to that of the vector.
  - 'For a surface defined by *stem:[r]* = *stem:[f]*(stem:[u], stem:[v]) where stem:[(
    u , v ) in U sube R^2], the vector surface element is given by


    stem:[((del f))/((del u)) xx ((del f))/((del v)) * d u d v].'
  - A vector surface element is preferably designated by stem:[e_n d A] or sometimes
    by stem:[n d A], where stem:[e_n = n] is a unit vector normal to the surface and
    dstem:[A] is a scalar surface element.
