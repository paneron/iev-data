  definition: a vector quantity given by the volume integral of the magnetic polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The magnetic dipole moment is related to the magnetic area moment stem:[m] by
    the expression stem:[j] =stem:[μ]~0~ stem:[m] where stem:[m] is defined in part
    121 and stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant.
