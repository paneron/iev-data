  definition: the ideal operating condition of a synchronous machine connected to
    the network in which the electrical angular velocity of the machine corresponds
    with the network frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under practical operating conditions the angular velocity of the machine may slightly
    oscillate around the ideal value.
