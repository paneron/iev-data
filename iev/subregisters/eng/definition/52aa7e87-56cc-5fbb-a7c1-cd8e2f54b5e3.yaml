  definition: 'for a photon emitter, the product of the exposure rate stem:[overset(˙)(X)],
    at a given distance stem:[l] from a point radiation source of that emitter and
    the square of that distance divided by the activity stem:[A] of the radiation
    source neglecting attenuation


    stem:[Gamma = overset(˙)(X) ( l^2 // A )]'
