  definition: time stem:[Ï„] in the expression stem:[F ( t ) = A + B e^(- t // tau)]
    of a quantity stem:[F] growing or decaying exponentially towards a constant value
    stem:[A] with increasing time stem:[t], or in the expression stem:[F ( t ) = A
    + f ( t ) e^(- t // tau)] of an exponentially damped oscillation, where stem:[f]
    is a periodic function of time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The time constant of an exponentially varying quantity is the duration of a time
    interval at the end of which the absolute value of the difference between the
    quantity and the limit has decreased to 1/e of the absolute value of this difference
    at the beginning of the time interval, where e is the base of natural logarithms.
  - The time constant of a damped oscillation is the inverse of the damping coefficient.
