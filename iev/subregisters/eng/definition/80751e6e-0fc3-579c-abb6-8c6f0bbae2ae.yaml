  definition: qualifies a passive circuit element or a passive circuit for which the
    time integral of the instantaneous power is not always positive over any time
    interval beginning at an instant before the first supply of electric energy
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under periodic conditions, the integration interval can comprise an integral number
    of periods instead of beginning at minus infinity. In this case, the time integral
    of the instantaneous power is zero.
