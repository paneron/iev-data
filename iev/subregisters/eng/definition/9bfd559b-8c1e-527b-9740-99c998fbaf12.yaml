  definition: time integral of squared, instantaneous A-frequency-weighted sound pressure
    over a stated time interval or event, such as an aircraft flyover. The frequency
    weighting may be other than A, if so specified
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Duration of integration is implicitly included in the integral, and need not be
    reported explicitly.
  - The unit of sound exposure is the pascal-squared second (Pa^2^s), if time is in
    seconds ; the pascal-squared kilosecond (Pa^2^ks), if time is in kiloseconds ;
    the pascal-squared hour (Pa^2^h), if time is in hours.
