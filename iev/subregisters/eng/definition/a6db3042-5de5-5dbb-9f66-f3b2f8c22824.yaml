  definition: quantity, defined by a conventional measurement procedure, for which
    a total ordering relation can be established, according to magnitude, with other
    quantities of the same kind, but for which no algebraic operations among those
    quantities exist
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Ordinal quantities can enter into empirical relations only and have neither units
    of measurement nor dimension. Differences and ratios of ordinal quantities have
    no physical meaning.
  - Ordinal quantities are arranged according to ordinal value scales.
  - 'Examples: Rockwell C hardness, octane number for petroleum fuel, earthquake strength
    on the Richter scale, subjective level of abdominal pain on a scale from zero
    to five.'
