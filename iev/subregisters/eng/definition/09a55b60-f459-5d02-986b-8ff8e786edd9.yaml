  definition: quotient of the reflected luminance at a point on a surface of a non-self-radiating
    medium in a given direction and that of the perfect reflecting diffuser identically
    irradiated and viewed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reflected luminance factor for a spectrally non-neutral surface depends upon
    the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> of the illumination.
    This quantity has to be specified.
  - The reflected luminance factor has unit one.
