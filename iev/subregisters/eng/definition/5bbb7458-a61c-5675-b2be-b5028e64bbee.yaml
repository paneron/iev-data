  definition: 'in a magnetic core operating in the Rayleigh region, the tangent of
    the magnetic loss angle due to hysteresis divided by the product of the peak current
    stem:[î] in, and the square root of the inductance stem:[L] of, the measuring
    coil:


    stem:[eta_i = ((tan delta_h))/((î sqrt(L)))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The relation between the hysteresis material constant stem:[η]~B~ and the hysteresis
    core constant is:


    stem:[eta_i = eta_B sqrt(((mu_0 mu_e^3))/((V_e)))]


    where stem:[μ]~e~ is the effective permeability and stem:[V]~e~ the effective
    volume.'
