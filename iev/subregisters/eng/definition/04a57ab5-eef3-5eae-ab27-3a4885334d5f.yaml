  definition: a controllable valve device which is not capable of blocking any voltage
    of more than several volts in its non-conducting direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In certain power electronic circuits such valve devices require means to suppress
    any reverse voltages, e.g. inverse parallel connected non-controllable valve devices
    (rectifier diodes).
