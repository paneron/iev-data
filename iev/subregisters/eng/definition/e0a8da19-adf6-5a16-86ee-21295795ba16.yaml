data:
  definition: quantity equal to shear stress stem:[τ] divided by shear strain stem:[γ],
    under given conditions, thus stem:[G] = stem:[τ] / stem:[γ]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Usually, an isothermal process is considered.
  - 2 In anisotropic media, modulus of rigidity may depend on the orientation.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of modulus of rigidity is pascal, Pa.
