data:
  definition: phenomenon where superconducting electrons are observed within a normal
    conductor when a superconducting material contacts it
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This effect is accompanied by a decrease in critical temperature and critical
    field strength of the superconductor.
  - The "proximity effect" is defined with a different meaning in IEV 121-13-19.
