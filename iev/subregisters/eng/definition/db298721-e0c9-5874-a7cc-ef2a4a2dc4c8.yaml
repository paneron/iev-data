  definition: 'quotient of dstem:[EΔ] by dstem:[l], where dstem:[EΔ] is the energy
    lost by a charged particle due to electronic collisions in traversing a distance
    dstem:[l,] minus the sum of the kinetic energies of all the electrons released
    with kinetic energies in excess of threshold energy delta


    stem:[LΔ] = (dstem:[EΔ]/dstem:[l])'
