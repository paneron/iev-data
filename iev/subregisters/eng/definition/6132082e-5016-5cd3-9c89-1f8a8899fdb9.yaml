  definition: any of a class of extremely broadband antennas which possess the property
    that the lower and upper limits of the band over which their impedance and radiation
    pattern remain almost constant are fixed respectively by the antenna's maximum
    physical size and by the minimum spacing at the feed point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The equiangular spiral antenna and log-periodic antenna are notable examples of
    frequency independent antennas.
