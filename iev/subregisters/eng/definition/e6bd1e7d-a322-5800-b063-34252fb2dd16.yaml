  definition: state of helium which, in the pressure vs. temperature curve, is represented
    by the region surrounded by the melting curve, the vapour pressure curve, and
    a line (stem:[λ] line) which connects two points, upper stem:[λ] point (1,76 K
    and 3,0 MPa) and lower stem:[λ] point (2,18 K and 5,0 kPa)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Saturated superfluid helium: superfluid helium which exists on the vapour pressure
    curve below lower stem:[λ] point in the pressure vs. temperature curve.'
  - 'Pressurized superfluid helium: superfluid helium which exists above the vapour
    pressure curve below lower stem:[λ] point in the pressure vs. temperature curve.'
  - Superfluid helium has very small viscosity and large thermal conductivity.
