  definition: for a linear passive two-terminal-pair network, each of the impedances
    stem:[Z]~i1~ and stem:[Z]~i2~ where the input impedance at port 1 is stem:[Z]~i1~
    when the terminating impedance of port 2 is stem:[Z]~i2~ and the input impedance
    at port 2 is stem:[Z]~i2~ when the terminating impedance of port 1 is stem:[Z]~i1~
