  definition: 'law relating the apparent contrast, stem:[Cd], of an object against
    a sky background, at a given distance of observation, stem:[d], to the inherent
    contrast, stem:[C]~0~, and to the atmospheric transmissivity, stem:[T], which
    is assumed to be uniform


    stem:[C_d = C_0 T^(d // d_0)]


    where stem:[d]~0~ is the length specified for the definition of stem:[T]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The formula is sometimes written


    stem:[C_d = C_0 T^(delta)]


    where the exponent, stem:[δ], in stem:[Tδ] is the numerical value of stem:[d]
    measured with stem:[d]~0~ as "unit".'
  - 'Taking into account the relationship between atmospheric transmissivity, stem:[T],
    and meteorological optical range, stem:[v], given in Note 2 to entry of "<a href="IEV845-31-018">meteorological
    optical range</a>", Koschmieder''s law can be also written as


    stem:[C_d = C_0 ( 0,05^(d // v) )]'
  - The contrast is taken to be the quotient of the difference between the luminance
    of the object and the luminance of the background, and the luminance of the background.
