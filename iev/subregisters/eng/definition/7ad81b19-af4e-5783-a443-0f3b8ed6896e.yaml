  definition: level in decibels equal to ten times the logarithm to the base ten of
    the ratio of the backscattering coefficient of the volume to the reference volume
    backscattering coefficient 4π/stem:[r]~0~, where stem:[r]~0~ is the reference
    distance, preferably chosen to be 1 m
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Whatever reference coefficient is used, it shall be specified.
  - The volume scattering differential for a designated direction other than backward
    is similarly defined.
  - Otherwise described, the volume backscattering differential is the backscattered
    sound pressure level that would exist at the reference distance of stem:[r]~0~
    from the acoustic centre of the volume containing scatterers, minus the sound
    pressure level of a plane wave incident on the scatterers.
  - 'Expressed in letter symbols:


    stem:[N_V = L_((SC)) - L_i = 10 (log)_((10)) ((A_V // V))/((4 pi r_0^2 // V_0))
    dB = 10 (log)_((10)) (m)/((4 pi // r_0)) dB]


    where:


    stem:[N]~stem:[V]~  is volume backscattering differential or volume scattering
    strength


    stem:[L]~SC~  is backscattered sound pressure level at reference distance


    stem:[L]~i~  is incident sound pressure level


    stem:[A]~stem:[V]~  is backscattering cross-section of scatterers in volume stem:[V]


    stem:[r]~0~  is reference distance


    stem:[V_0 = r_0^3] is reference volume


    stem:[m] = stem:[A]~stem:[V]~ /stem:[V]  is volume backscattering coefficient


    stem:[4 pi // r_0 = 4 pi r_0^2 // V_0] is reference volume backscattering coefficient.'
