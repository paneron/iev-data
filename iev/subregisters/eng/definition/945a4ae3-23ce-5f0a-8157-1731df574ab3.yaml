  definition: relation stem:[f] such that for any entity stem:[a] there is exactly
    one entity stem:[b] to which stem:[a] is related by stem:[f]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "If stem:[a] is related to stem:[b] by the function stem:[f], then:\n\n\n\n* stem:[f]\
    \ is said to be defined for stem:[a], \n\n* stem:[a] is an argument of the function\
    \ stem:[f], \n\n* stem:[b] is a value of the function stem:[f] and is usually\
    \ denoted by stem:[f](stem:[a]). \n\nThe argument may be an elementary entity,\
    \ such as a number, or an ordered set of elementary entities, and the same for\
    \ the value."
  - 'If stem:[A] is the set of all arguments of the function stem:[f] and stem:[B]
    is a set containing all the values, then:  * stem:[f] is said to be a mapping
    of stem:[A] into stem:[B], * stem:[A] is the domain of the function, * stem:[B]
    is the range or codomain of the function. '
  - The term "function" may be qualified according to the nature of the value, e.g.
    real function, complex function, vector function, or to the character of the relation,
    e.g. algebraic function, trigonometric function, hyperbolic function.
  - The term "operation" is used for elementary arithmetic functions such as addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, and also for logical functions.
  - The term "operation" has other meanings in {{IEV 151-11-28, IEV:151-11-28}} and
    {{IEV 151-11-30, IEV:151-11-30}}.
