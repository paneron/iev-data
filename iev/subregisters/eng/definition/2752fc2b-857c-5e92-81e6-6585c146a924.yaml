  definition: 'one of the following two quotients:


    a) for transduction of an electric signal into an acoustic signal, quotient of
    the resulting sound pressure in the blocked acoustical system by the excitation
    current in the electrical system;


    b) for transduction of an acoustic signal into an electric signal, quotient of
    the resulting open-circuit voltage in the electrical system by the excitation
    volume velocity in the acoustical system'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These definitions are best applied to a reciprocal electroacoustic transducer
    with gyroscopic coupling, for example an electromagnetic transducer, in which
    case the two quotients have equal magnitude.
