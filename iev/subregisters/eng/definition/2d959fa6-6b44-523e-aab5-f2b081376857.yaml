  definition: the limit of the natural logarithm of the ratio of values at a given
    frequency of a specified component of electromagnetic field at two points aligned
    in the direction of propagation of a guided or plane wave, or of a wave practically
    plane in a limited space domain, divided by the distance between the two points
    when this distance tends to zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The propagation coefficient is a complex quantity usually a function of frequency,
    and has the dimension of reciprocal length. The real part, the attenuation coefficient,
    is usually expressed in Np/m and the imaginary part, the phase-change coefficient,
    is expressed in rad/m.
