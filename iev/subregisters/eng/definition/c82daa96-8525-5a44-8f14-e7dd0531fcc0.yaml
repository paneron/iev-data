  definition: length of the path in the atmosphere that is required to attenuate by
    95 % the luminous flux in a collimated beam from a source at a colour temperature
    of 2 700 K
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of the attenuation has been chosen so that the meteorological optical
    range provides an approximate measure of the commonly used concept of meteorological
    visibility.
  - 'The meteorological optical range, stem:[v], is related to the atmospheric transmissivity,
    stem:[T], assumed to be uniform, by the formula


    stem:[v = d_0 ((log 0,05))/((log T))] or stem:[T = 0,05^(d_0 // v)]


    where stem:[d]~0~ is the length specified in the definition of atmospheric transmissivity.


    These formulae are sometimes written


    stem:[v = ((log 0,05))/((log T))] or stem:[T = 0,05^(1 // v)]


    with stem:[d]~0~ set to unity.'
