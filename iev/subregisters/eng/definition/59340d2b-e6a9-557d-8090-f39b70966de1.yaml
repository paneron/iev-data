  definition: for a linearly polarized antenna receiving a plane wave, the ratio of
    the magnitude of the open circuit voltage developed at the terminals of the antenna,
    to the magnitude of that component of the electric field strength in the direction
    of the antenna polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "effective height" is especially used for antennas with vertical polarization.
