  definition: 'mean value of the {{transinformation content, IEV:171-07-26}} stem:[T](stem:[xi],stem:[xj])
    of two events stem:[xi] and stem:[yj], each in one of two finite sets of mutually
    exclusive and jointly exhaustive events


    stem:[T ( X , Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p ( x_i , y_j ) * T ( x_i
    , y_j )]


    where


    stem:[X] &amp;equals; {stem:[x]~1~, …, stem:[x]~stem:[n]~} is the set of events
    stem:[xi] (stem:[i] &amp;equals; 1, …, stem:[n]), stem:[Y] &amp;equals; {stem:[y]~1~,
    …, stem:[y]~stem:[m]~} is the set of events stem:[yj] (stem:[j] &amp;equals; 1,
    …, stem:[m]) and stem:[p](stem:[xi],stem:[yj]) the joint probability that both
    events occur'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The mean transinformation content is symmetric in stem:[X] and stem:[Y]. It is
    also equal to the difference between the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} of one of
    the two sets of events and the {{conditional entropy, IEV:171-07-23}} of this
    set relative to the other: stem:[T ( X | Y ) = H ( X ) - H ( X | Y ) = H ( Y )
    - H ( Y | X ) = T ( X | Y )].'
  - The mean transinformation content is a quantitative measure of information transmitted
    through a channel, when stem:[X] is a specific set of messages at the message
    source and stem:[Y] is a specific set of messages at the message sink. It is equal
    to the difference between the entropy at the message source and the {{equivocation,
    IEV:171-07-24}}, or the difference between the entropy at the message sink and
    the {{irrelevance, IEV:171-07-25}}.
