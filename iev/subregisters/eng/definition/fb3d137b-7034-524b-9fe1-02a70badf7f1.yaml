  definition: a paraboloidal reflector antenna with a concave sub-reflector ellipsoidal
    in shape, located at a distance from the vertex of the main reflector, that distance
    being greater than the prime focal length of the main reflector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - To improve the aperture efficiency of the antenna, the shapes of the main reflector
    and sub-reflector are sometimes modified with respect to the ideal paraboloidal
    and ellipsoidal geometrical forms.
