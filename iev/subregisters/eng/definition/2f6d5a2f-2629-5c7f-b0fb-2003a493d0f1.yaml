  definition: the time response of a two port device produced by the application to
    the input of a unit impulse represented by a Dirac delta function
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The delta function representing the unit pulse may be considered as the limit
    of a function of zero value except within a small time interval around the origin,
    positive in this interval and having an integral constantly equal to unity when
    the width of the interval tends to zero.
  - The unit pulse may be considered as the time derivative of the unit step.
  - The unit pulse response may be considered as the time derivative of the unit step
    response of a linear and time-invariant two-port device.
