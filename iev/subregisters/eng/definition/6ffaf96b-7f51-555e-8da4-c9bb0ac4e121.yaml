  definition: '{{electromagnetic noise, IEV:161-01-02}} attributable to the discrete
    particle nature of {{electromagnetic radiation, IEV:161-01-10}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At normal temperatures, quantum noise is of importance only for extremely high
    {{frequencies, IEV:103-06-02}}, such as those of {{optical radiation, IEV:731-01-03}}.
