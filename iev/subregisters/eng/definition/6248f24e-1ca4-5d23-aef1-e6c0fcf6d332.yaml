data:
  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between the magnetic
    losses stem:[Pα], measured at an angle stem:[α] to the direction of rolling, and
    the magnetic losses, stem:[P]~0~, measured along the direction of rolling, to
    stem:[P]~0~, the ratio being expressed as a percentage:


    stem:[T_L = ((P_(alpha) - P_0))/((P_0)) xx 100 %]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The measurements of stem:[Pα] and stem:[P]~0~ are to be made under the same conditions.
  - The loss anisotropy factor at a given angle differs both conceptually and numerically
    from the loss anisotropy factor stem:[T] ({{IEV 221-03-38, IEV:221-03-38}}).
