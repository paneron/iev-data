  definition: 'scalar line integral of a magnetic vector potential *stem:[A]* along
    a curve C:


    stem:[Psi = underset(C)( int ) A * d r]


    where d*stem:[r]* is the vector line element'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For a closed curve C, the linked flux is equal to the magnetic flux through any
    surface S bounded by the curve:


    stem:[underset(C)( oint ) A * d r = underset(S)( int ) B * e_n d A]


    where *stem:[B]* is the magnetic flux density and *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] the vector
    surface element.'
  - For a coil with N turns, the linked flux is approximately equal to stem:[NΦ] where
    stem:[Φ] is the magnetic flux through any surface bounded by one turn.
