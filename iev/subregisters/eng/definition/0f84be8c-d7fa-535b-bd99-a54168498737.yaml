  definition: 'quotient of the average radiant flux density or luminous flux density,
    stem:[Φ]~2~/stem:[A]~2~ (or stem:[Φ]~1~/stem:[A]~1~), received over surface S~2~
    (or S~1~) from surface S~1~ (or S~2~) and the radiant exitance or luminous exitance,
    stem:[M]~1~ (or stem:[M]~2~), of surface S~1~ (or S~2~)


    stem:[f_((21)) = ((Phi_2))/((A_2 M_1)) = (g)/((A_2))]


    or


    stem:[f_((12)) = ((Phi_1))/((A_1 M_2)) = (g)/((A_1))]


    with


    stem:[A_2 f_((21)) = g = A_1 f_((12))]


    where stem:[Φ]~2~ (or stem:[Φ]~1~) is the radiant flux or luminous flux received
    over surface S~2~ (or S~1~) from surface S~1~ (or S~2~), stem:[A]~2~ (or stem:[A]~1~)
    is the area of surface S~2~ (or S~1~) and stem:[g] is the mutual exchange coefficient'
