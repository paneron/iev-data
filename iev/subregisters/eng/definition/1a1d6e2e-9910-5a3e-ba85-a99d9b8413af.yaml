  definition: '{{standard, IEV:901-02-02}} that specifies {{requirement, IEV:901-05-05}}s
    to be fulfilled by a product or a group of products, to establish its {{fitness

  notes:
  - A product standard may include in addition to the fitness for purpose requirements,
    directly or by reference, aspects such as terminology, {{sampling, IEV:902-03-01}},
    {{testing, IEV:902-03-02}}, packaging and labelling and, sometimes, processing
    requirements.
  - A product standard can be either complete or not, according to whether it specifies
    all or only a part of the necessary requirements. In this respect, one may differentiate
    between standards such as dimensional, material, and technical delivery standards.
