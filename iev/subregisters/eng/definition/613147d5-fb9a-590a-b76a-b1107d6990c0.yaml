  definition: the width of the rectangular pass-band of an ideal linear two port device
    of constant gain in this pass band equal to the maximum gain of a real linear
    two-port device and such that, if the same source of white noise were connected
    to the inputs of the two devices supposed to be both free from internal noise,
    the same noise power would be available at the two outputs
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If the available power gain of the real two-port device is a function of frequency
    stem:[G](stem:[f]) having a maximum value stem:[G]~M~, the noise bandwidth of
    the two-port device is given by:


    stem:[f = (1)/((G_M)) int_0^(oo) G ( f ) d f]'
