        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: d7052ab5-c30b-56a6-a5e1-9450ff7c68ad
  definition: maximum possible {{character mean transinformation content, IEV:171-07-30}},
    which can be achieved with an arbitrary small {{error probability, IEV:171-06-08}}
    by use of an appropriate {{code, IEV:171-01-15}}

  notes:
  - The channel capacity per character is one way to express quantitatively the ability
    of a given channel subject to specific constraints to transmit messages from a
    specified message source.
  - The channel capacity per character can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon
    per character.
