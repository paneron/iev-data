  definition: 'the square root stem:[Z]~0~ of the magnetic constant stem:[μ]~0~ divided
    by the electric constant stem:[ε]~0~


    stem:[Z_0 = sqrt(((mu_0))/((epsilon_0)))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the International System of units (SI), the characteristic impedance of vacuum
    is equal to:


    stem:[Z]~0~ = stem:[c]~0~ · 4π × 10^−7^ H/m


    stem:[c]~0~ being the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum; stem:[Z]~0~
    is approximately equal to 120π Ω or 377 Ω.'
