  definition: element of the unique totally ordered set consisting of the rational
    numbers and all limits of infinite sequences of rational numbers, with the same
    operations as for rational numbers
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The rational numbers are also real numbers. Irrational numbers, i.e. real numbers
    other than rational numbers, are for example stem:[sqrt(2)] = 1,414 2..., π =
    3,141 5..., e = 2,718 2... For such numbers, the sequence of digits after the
    decimal sign is infinite without any periodic repetition.
  - The set of real numbers is denoted by ℝ (R with left vertical bar and right part
    doubled), or *R*, or sometimes R with left vertical bar doubled. This set without
    zero is denoted by an asterisk to the symbol, for example ℝ*.
