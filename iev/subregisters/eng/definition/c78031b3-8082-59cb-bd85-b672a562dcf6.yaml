  definition: the placement of the irradiated object so that its surface nearer the
    X-ray film is separated from the film holder by a distance of air
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By this procedure, part of the scattered radiation from the object does not impinge
    on the film beneath the object. However, the use of a distance technique makes
    enlarged radiographs and increases the unsharpness of shadows of the object.
