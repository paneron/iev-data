data:
  definition: quantity stem:[C] = dstem:[Q]/dstem:[T], when the thermodynamic temperature
    of a system is increased by dstem:[T] as a result of the addition of a amount
    of heat dstem:[Q], under given condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Examples of condition might be constant volume or constant pressure for a gas.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of heat capacity is joule per kelvin, J/K.
