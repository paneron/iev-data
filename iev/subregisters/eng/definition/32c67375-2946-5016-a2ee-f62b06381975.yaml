  definition: 'quantity that correlates with the more or less luminous aspect of a
    star and that is defined by the formula


    stem:[m] = stem:[m]~o~ − 2,5 log~10~(stem:[E]~pb~/stem:[E]~o~)


    where stem:[E]~pb~ is the point brilliance of the star considered, stem:[m]~o~
    and stem:[E]~o~ are constants based on the magnitudes ascribed to certain standard
    stars'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In addition to the (visual) apparent magnitude defined here, other apparent magnitudes
    (photographic, bolometric, etc.) are defined by the same formula, but where stem:[E]~pb~
    and stem:[E]~o~ are the responses of a detector having a specified spectral responsivity.
  - The apparent magnitude has unit one.
