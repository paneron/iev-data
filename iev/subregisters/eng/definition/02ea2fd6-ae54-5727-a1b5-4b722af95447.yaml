  definition: vector pointing in the direction of motion of a minute amount of air
    surrounding the point of consideration, the magnitude of the vector being equal
    to the speed of motion of this air “parcel” (i.e. the local wind speed)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The vector at any point is thus the time derivative of the position vector of
    the air “parcel” moving through the point.
