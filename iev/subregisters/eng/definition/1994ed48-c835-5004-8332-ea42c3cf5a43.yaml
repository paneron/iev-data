  definition: compensated semiconductor detector in which the compensated region is
    obtained by causing lithium (N-type) ions to move through a P-type crystal under
    an applied electric field at high temperatures, in such a way as to balance (compensate)
    the bound impurities
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This type of detector must be kept at low temperatures to maintain the lithium
    concentration in the compensated region. These detectors have generally been replaced
    by high purity detectors which do not require a dopant to create the compensated
    region.
