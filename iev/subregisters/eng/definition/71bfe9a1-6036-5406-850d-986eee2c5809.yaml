data:
  definition: luminous flux leaving the LED and propagating within a given cone angle,
    stem:[Î±], (centred from the LED's mechanical axis) that is determined by a circular
    aperture of 50 mm in diameter and the distance measured from the tip of the LED
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A detailed method of measurement is given in CIE 127, _Measurement of LEDs_.
  - Partial LED flux is a quantity that applies to a single LED only and should not
    be confused with the term "<a href="IEV845-21-110">partial luminous flux</a>".
  - The partial LED flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
