  definition: an antenna comprised of a number of generally identical radiating elements,
    arranged, oriented and excited to obtain a prescribed radiation pattern
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In most cases radiating elements are identical and congruent by translation or
    by rotation about an axis; moreover they are in general regulary spaced.
  - In French, unless otherwise specified, the use of the term "antenne en r√©seau"
    implies that radiating elements are congruent by a simple translation.
