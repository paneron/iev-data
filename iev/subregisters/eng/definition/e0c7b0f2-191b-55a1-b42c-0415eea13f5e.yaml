data:
  definition: the average life expectancy of a nucleus of a particular radionuclide
    which is the time in which the number of nuclei of the radionuclide is reduced
    to the fraction 1/stem:[e] (≈ 0,368) of its initial value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '– It is related to the decay constant stem:[λ] and the half-life stem:[T_(((1)/(2)))]
    by:


    stem:[tau = (1)/(lambda) = ((T_(((1)/(2)))))/((ln 2)) ≃ ((T_(((1)/(2)))))/((0
    , 693)) ≃ 1 , 433 T_(((1)/(2)))]'
