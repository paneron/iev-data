  definition: 'the complex quotient of the magnetic flux density and magnetic field
    strength in a material when one of these quantities varies sinusoidally with time
    and that component of the other is chosen which varies sinusoidally with time
    at the same frequency, that is, the fundamental component. The vectors representing
    the flux density and field strength are assumed to be collinear :


    stem:[µ] = stem:[μ''] − j stem:[μ'''']


    where stem:[µ''] and stem:[µ"] are the real and imaginary components respectively
    of the complex permeability'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In general, a number of the permeabilities defined herein may be expressed as
    complex permeability. Where such permeabilities are expressed by symbols not indicating
    that they are complex or that they are components of a complex number, the real
    part is assumed.
