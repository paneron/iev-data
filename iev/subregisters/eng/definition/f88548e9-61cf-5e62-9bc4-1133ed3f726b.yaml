  definition: production process of superconducting wires which starts with a number
    of nested tubes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A copper tube filled with Sn or Sn alloy bars is inserted into a Nb tube, which
    is inserted into another Cu tube. This forms an element of the composite. A number
    of elements are bundled and processed to form a thin wire followed by a heat treatment
    which forms a Nb~3~Sn layer on the inside of each Nb tube.
