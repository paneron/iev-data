  definition: the ratio of the voltage applied to the capacitor divider to the open
    circuit intermediate voltage
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This ratio corresponds to the sum of the capacitances of the high-voltage and
    intermediate-voltage capacitors divided by the capacitance of the high-voltage
    capacitor.
