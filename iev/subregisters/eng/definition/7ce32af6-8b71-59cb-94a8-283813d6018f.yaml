  definition: image state associated with image data that represents estimates of
    the colour space coordinates of the elements of a scene
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the phrase "scene-referred" is used as a qualifier to an object, it implies
    that the object is in a scene-referred image state. For example, scene-referred
    image data are image data in a scene-referred image state.
  - Scene-referred image data can be determined from raw digital still camera (DSC)
    image data before colour rendering is performed. Generally, DSCs do not write
    scene-referred image data in image files, but some can do so in a special mode
    intended for this purpose. Typically, DSCs write standard output-referred image
    data where colour rendering has already been performed.
  - Scene-referred image data typically represent relative scene colorimetry estimates.
    Absolute scene colorimetry estimates can be calculated using a scaling factor.
    The scaling factor can be derived from additional information such as the image
    opto-electronic conversion function (OECF), the stem:[F] number or aperture value,
    and the exposure time or shutter speed value tags.
  - Scene-referred image data can contain inaccuracies due to the dynamic range limitations
    of the capture device, noise from various sources, quantization, optical blurring
    and flare that are not corrected for, and colour analysis errors due to capture
    device metamerism. In some cases, these sources of inaccuracy can be significant.
  - The transformation from raw DSC image data to scene-referred image data depends
    on the relative <a href="IEV845-32-058">adopted whites</a> selected for the scene
    and the colour space used to encode the image data. If the chosen scene adopted
    white is inappropriate, additional errors will be introduced into the scene-referred
    image data. These errors can be correctable if the transformation used to produce
    the scene-referred image data is known, and the colour encoding used for the incorrect
    scene-referred image data has adequate precision and dynamic range.
  - The scene can correspond to an actual view of the natural world, or can be a computer-generated
    virtual scene simulating such a view. It can also correspond to a modified scene
    determined by applying modifications to an original scene to produce some different
    desired scene. Any such scene modifications should leave the image in a scene-referred
    image state, and should be done in the context of an expected colour rendering
    transform.
