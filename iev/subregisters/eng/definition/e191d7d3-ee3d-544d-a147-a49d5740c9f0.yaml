data:
  definition: method to determine fracture toughness in which compliance of the test
    specimen is measured by unloading repeatedly to determine the crack propagation
    length under loading
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Fracture toughness is determined by using a relation between the released energy
    or stress intensity factor and the crack propagation length.
