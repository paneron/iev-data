  concept: 49ecab63-ebee-5bfd-ba10-51ada9c40cec
  definition: neutron with a kinetic energy close to that of neutrons in thermal equilibrium
    with the atomic nuclei of the surrounding medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of a maxwellian nuclei distribution, the most probable energy is equal
    to 0,025 eV (1/40 eV) at 293 K.
  - In practice the upper limit is about 1 eV.
  - This entry was numbered 393-12-79 in IEC 60050-393:2003.
