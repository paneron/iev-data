  definition: filter derived from an active RC filter in which ideal resistors are
    replaced by electric circuits made up of ideal capacitors and periodic switches
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A simulated resistance is generally a function of the ratio of two capacitances
    because this ratio is better controlled in an integrated circuit than the capacitances
    themselves.
