  notes:
  - Any transition of equipment from or towards a neighbouring mode, either through
    user intervention or automatically initiated, should not be considered to form
    part of either mode.
  - Delay between a stimulus and a response might be traded against power consumption
    in the current mode.
  - 'Table 1 provides a structured overview as an aid to understanding this and other
    concepts relating to energy efficiency and power consumption applicable in electrotechnical
    products. Additional terms to fulfil the particular needs of particular product
    sectors should be defined within the structure of the concepts shown in Table
    1.

    <simg>


    As the number of functions increases from left to right in Table 1, the relevant
    modes will generally have higher energy consumption. The existence of a mode in
    Table 1 does not imply that a particular piece of equipment will offer that mode.</simg>'
