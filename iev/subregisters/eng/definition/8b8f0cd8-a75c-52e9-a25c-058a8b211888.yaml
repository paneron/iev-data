  definition: representation in space, in the form of a surface expressed in polar
    coordinates, of the angular distribution of (relative) radiant intensity or luminous
    intensity or of (relative) radiance or luminance of an element of the surface
    of a medium that diffuses by reflection or transmission
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a narrow incident beam of radiation, it is convenient to represent the scattering
    indicatrix in Cartesian coordinates. If the angular distribution has rotational
    symmetry, a meridian section of the surface is sufficient.
  - The term "indicatrix" is often used to denote, instead of the surface, the curve
    obtained in a similar manner in a plane normal to the element concerned.
