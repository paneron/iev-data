  definition: 'sum of the reflected spectral radiance factor, stem:[β]~R~(stem:[λ]),
    and the luminescent spectral radiance factor, stem:[β]~L~(stem:[λ])


    stem:[β]~T~(stem:[λ]) = stem:[β]~R~(stem:[λ]) + stem:[β]~L~(stem:[λ])'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For fluorescence colorimetric applications, it is implicit that the quantity used
    in the colorimetric calculations is the total radiance factor, and it is common
    to omit the subscript T.
  - The total spectral radiance factor has unit one.
