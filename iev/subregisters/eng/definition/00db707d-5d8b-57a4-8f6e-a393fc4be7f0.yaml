  definition: 'the quotient of the energy dstem:[E]~col~ lost by a charged particle
    of specified energy, by collision in traversing a path length dstem:[l] in a material:


    stem:[S_((col)) = (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_((col))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The energy losses included are those that produce excitation and ionization of
    atoms as well as those producing recoil atoms.
