  definition: half the vertex angle of the cone incorporating a specified proportion
    of the divergent light beam emitted by the end of an optical fibre
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The cone is usually defined by the angle at which the far-field irradiance has
    decreased to a specified fraction of its maximum value or as the cone within which
    can be found a specified fraction of the total radiated power at any point in
    the far field.
