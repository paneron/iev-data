  definition: 'for a reciprocal electroacoustic transducer, at a specified frequency:


    a) quotient of the voltage sensitivity of the transducer functioning as a receiver
    of sound (e.g. a microphone) by the sensitivity to current of the transducer functioning
    as an emitter of sound; or


    b) quotient of the current sensitivity of the transducer functioning as a receiver
    of sound (e.g. a microphone) by the sensitivity to voltage of the transducer functioning
    as an emitter of sound'
