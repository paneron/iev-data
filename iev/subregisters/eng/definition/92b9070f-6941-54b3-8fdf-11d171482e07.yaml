  definition: an indivisible electronic device for electronic power conversion or
    electronic power switching, comprising a single non-controllable or bistably controlled
    unidirectionally conducting current path
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Typical electronic valve devices are thyristors, power rectifier diodes, power
    switching bipolar and field effect transistors and insulated gate bipolar transistors
    (IGBT).
  - 'Two or more electronic valve devices may be integrated on a common semiconductor
    chip (examples: a thyristor and a rectifier diode in a reverse conducting thyristor,
    a power switching field effect transistor with its inverse diode) or packaged
    in a common case (semiconductor power module). These combinations are to be considered
    as separate electronic valve devices.'
