  definition: quotient of radiant flux weighted by the <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral
    luminous efficiency</a> and the corresponding radiant flux for a specified photometric
    condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic).
    If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the symbol stem:[V] is
    used. For other photometric conditions, the respective symbol for identification
    shall be used.
  - 'Luminous efficiency for photopic vision is expressed by


    stem:[V = ((int_0^(oo) Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda))/((int_0^(oo)
    Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) d lambda)) = (K)/((K_m))]


    where stem:[Φ]~e,~stem:[λ] is spectral radiant flux, stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is spectral
    luminous efficiency, stem:[λ] is wavelength, stem:[K] is luminous efficacy of
    radiation, and stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy.'
  - The luminous efficiency has unit one.
