  definition: flux which flows through the core of a reproducing head which has zero
    reluctance and in intimate contact with the surface of the tape over an infinite
    length
  examples: []

  - The value of the short-circuit flux is expressed in nanoweber per metre of track
    width. In the case of a sinusoidal quantity, it should be indicated whether it
    is an r.m.s. or peak value.
