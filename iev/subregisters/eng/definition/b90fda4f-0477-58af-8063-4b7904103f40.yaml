data:
  definition: semiconductor diode that emits coherent optical radiation through stimulated
    emission resulting from the recombination of conduction electrons and holes when
    excited by an electric current that exceeds the threshold current of the diode
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The laser diode is mounted on a submount or in a package with or without coupling
    means (e.g. lens, pigtail).
