  definition: 'scalar, denoted by stem:[U * V], attributed to any pair of vectors
    *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* in a vector space by a given bilinear form, with the
    following properties:




    * symmetry: stem:[U * V = V * U],


    * stem:[U * U &gt; 0] for stem:[U != 0]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In an stem:[n]-dimensional space with orthonormal base vectors the scalar product
    of two vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* is the sum of the products of each coordinate
    stem:[U_i] of the vector *stem:[U]* and the corresponding coordinate stem:[V_i]
    of the vector *stem:[V]*:


    stem:[U * V = underset(i)( sum ) U_i V_i]'
  - For two complex vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* either the scalar product stem:[U
    * V] or a Hermitian product stem:[U * V *] may be used depending on the application.
  - A scalar product can be similarly defined for a pair consisting of a polar vector
    and an axial vector and is then a pseudo-scalar, or for a pair of two axial vectors
    and is then a scalar.
  - The scalar product of two vector quantities is the scalar product of the associated
    unit vectors multiplied by the product of the scalar quantities.
  - The scalar product is denoted by a half-high dot (Â·) between the two symbols representing
    the vectors.
