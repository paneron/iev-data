  definition: 'in a graphic representation of the relation between the magnetic flux
    density and the magnetic field strength relation in a material, a region near
    the origin within which the flux density can be described by a quadratic function
    of the field strength:


    stem:[(B)/((mu_0)) = ( mu_i + v hat H ) H +- (v)/(2) ( hat H^2 - H^2 )]


    where stem:[B] is the magnetic flux density


    stem:[µ]~0~ is the magnetic constant


    stem:[µ]~i~ is the initial permeability


    stem:[H] is the magnetic field strength


    stem:[hat H] is the peak value of stem:[H]


    and stem:[v] is the Rayleigh hysteresis coefficient'
