  definition: the velocity vector at a point, in a propagation medium, of a signal
    which may be ideally represented by two superimposed sinusoidal waves of equal
    amplitude and slightly different frequencies approaching a common limiting value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the most general case the reciprocal of the magnitude stem:[| vec v_g |] of
    the group velocity vector is equal to the derivative of the reciprocal of the
    wavelength stem:[Î»] with respect to the frequency stem:[f]:


    stem:[(1)/((| vec v_g |)) = ((d ( lambda^(- 1) )))/((d f))]'
