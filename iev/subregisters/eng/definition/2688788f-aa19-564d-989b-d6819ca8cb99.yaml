  definition: state quantity equal to the difference between the total energy of a
    system and the sum of the macroscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Internal energy may be expressed as a function of the state quantities of the
    system such as temperature, pressure, volume, masses, or amounts of substance.
  - 2 For a closed thermodynamic system, Î”stem:[U] = stem:[Q] + stem:[W], where stem:[Q]
    is amount of heat transferred to the system and stem:[W] is work done on the system
    provided that no chemical reactions occur.
  - 3 Specific internal energy, or internal energy per mass, is denoted stem:[u].
