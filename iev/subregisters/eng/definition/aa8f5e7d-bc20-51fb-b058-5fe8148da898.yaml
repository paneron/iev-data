  definition: the phenomenon by which the magnetization of a material or medium subjected
    to a magnetostatic field upon disturbance relaxes back to equilibrium by damped
    precessional motion about the direction of that field

  notes:
  - This precessional motion сan be maintained by аn alternating component аdded to
    the magnetostatic field.
