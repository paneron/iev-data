  definition: the recovery voltage during the time in which it has a significant transient
    character
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The transient recovery voltage may be oscillatory or non-oscillatory or a combination
    of these depending on the characteristics of the circuit and the switching device.
    It includes the voltage shift of the neutral of a polyphase circuit.
  - The transient recovery voltages in three-phase circuits is, unless otherwise stated,
    that across the first pole to clear, because this voltage is generally higher
    than that which appears across each of the other two poles.
