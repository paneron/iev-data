  definition: restoration without corrective maintenance

  notes:
  - IEC 60050-191:1990 (now withdrawn; replaced by IEC 60050-192:2015) identified
    the term “recovery” as a synonym of “restoration” ({{192-06-23, IEV:192-06-23}}),
    but this is not true in all cases.
  - See also self-recovery ({{192-06-25, IEV:192-06-25}}).
