data:
  definition: the maximum energy in joules which can be supplied to the anode in 20
    seconds under the condition specified by the manufacturer (e.g., focal spot, rotation
    speed of the anode, etc.)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value for the anode thermal capacity of the tube is obtained by using the
    largest focal spot, the highest rotation speed of the anode and a coefficient
    stem:[f] = 1.
