  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the apparent power that
    a specified source would deliver to a load with zero reflection factor at its
    interface with the source, to the apparent power delivered to a specified load
    after insertion of a given two port device between the source and the load
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the composite loss is less than one, its decibel value is
    negative and its converse or its opposite value in decibels called composite gain
    may be used.
