  definition: of a substance, for a parallel beam of specified radiation, the quantity
    stem:[μ] in the expression stem:[μ]dstem:[х] for the fraction of a radiation quantity
    removed by attenuation in passing through a thin layer dstem:[x] of that substance.
    It is a function of the energy of the radiation. According as to whether dstem:[x]
    is expressed in terms of length, mass per unit area, moles per unit area, or atoms
    per unit area stem:[μ] is called the linear, mass, molar, or atomic attenuation
    coefficient
