  definition: function to maintain a communication path external to the equipment
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The communication could be via wired or wireless interfaces.
  - In order to communicate, it is necessary for the equipment to have at least one
    network port activated.
  - The equipment is also considered to offer a network integrity function even though
    the equipment is not connected to the respective network (e.g. network cable unplugged).
  - 'Table 1 provides a structured overview as an aid to understanding this and other
    concepts relating to energy efficiency and power consumption applicable in electrotechnical
    products. Additional terms to fulfil the particular needs of particular product
    sectors should be defined within the structure of the concepts shown in Table
    1.


    *Table 1 â€“ Operating conditions of equipment in respect to power demand*


    <simg>


    As the number of functions increases from left to right in Table 1, the relevant
    modes will generally have higher energy consumption. The existence of a mode in
    Table 1 does not imply that a particular piece of equipment will offer that mode.</simg>'
