  definition: a hybrid junction with crystal diodes in one pair of uncoupled arms,
    the arms of the remaining pair being fed respectively from a signal source and
    a local oscillator; the resulting signals from the diodes are added in such a
    manner that the effects of noises issuing from the crystal mixers are minimized
    at the common output
