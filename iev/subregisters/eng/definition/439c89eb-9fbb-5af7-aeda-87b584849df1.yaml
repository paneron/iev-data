  definition: testing in which test cases are chosen using knowledge of the internal
    structure of the item under test
  examples: []
  notes:
  - White-box testing aims to achieve a defined level of coverage of the internal
    structure of the item under test and to correct any faults that are revealed.
    The technique is normally applied to software but the same approach can be used
    for hardware.
  - Software coverage may be measured at various levels, e.g., by the proportion of
    statements, branches, or paths through the code that have been executed.
  - White-box testing is usually employed at lower levels of software testing such
    as for unit or integration test.
