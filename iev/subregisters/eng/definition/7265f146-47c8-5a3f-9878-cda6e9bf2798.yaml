data:
  definition: type of heating of the electrodes of a discharge lamp in which the electrodes
    are fed by separate circuits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Each electrode is usually connected across a low-voltage winding that can be part
    of the ballast and provides the heating current. In certain circuits, this low
    voltage is automatically decreased after the arc has struck.
