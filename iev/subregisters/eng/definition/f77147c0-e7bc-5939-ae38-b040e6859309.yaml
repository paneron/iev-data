  definition: a curve relating the value of a radiation quantity and the thickness
    of material traversed by the radiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If these terms are used it should be stated:


    1. which radiation quantity is the dependent variable;


    2. whether the dependent variable is the logarithm of the radiation quantity;


    3. whether the incident beam is narrow and collimated and the measuring device
    beyond the attenuator is relatively small and far from it (narrow-beam measurements),
    or the incident beam is broad and not collimated and the measuring device beyond
    the attenuator is relatively near to it (broad-beam measurements).'
