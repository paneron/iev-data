  definition: 'quotient of the detector output, stem:[Y], and the detector input,
    stem:[X]


    stem:[s = (Y)/(X)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the detector signal is stem:[Y]~0~ in the absence of input, and is stem:[Y]~t~
    when there is an input stem:[X], the responsivity is stem:[s = ((Y_t - Y_0))/(X)].
  - The term "sensitivity" is no longer used.
