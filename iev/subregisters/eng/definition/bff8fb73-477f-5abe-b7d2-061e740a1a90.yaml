  definition: the modulus of the reciprocal of the reflection factor, generally expressed
    in decibels
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When impedances can be defined, the return loss is given by the formula:


    stem:[- 20 lg | r | = 20 lg | ((underset(_)(Z) - underset(_)(Z)^( '' )))/((underset(_)(Z)
    + underset(_)(Z)^( '' ))) |]


    where stem:[Z] is the characteristic impedance of a transmission line ahead of
    a discontinuity, or the impedance of a source, and stem:[Z]â€² is the impedance
    after the discontinuity or the load impedance seen from the junction between the
    source and the load.'
