data:
  definition: luminance in a given direction that results from emission at the surface
    of a photoluminescent medium under specified conditions of illumination, compared
    to the luminance in the same direction by the perfect reflecting diffuser identically
    illuminated
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The luminescent luminance factor depends upon the spectral power distribution
    of the illumination and this quantity is typically specified for a given CIE illuminant
    condition.
  - The luminescent luminance factor has unit one.
