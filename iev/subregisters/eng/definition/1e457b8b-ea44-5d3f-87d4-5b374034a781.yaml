data:
  definition: a process in which an incident wave, which meets a rough surface or
    a set of very numerous and randomly located obstacles or other irregularities
    gives rise to waves not interpretable by geometrical optics
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Scattering continuously distributes the energy of the incident wave in all directions
    with no well-defined phase relation between the waves scattered in different directions.
