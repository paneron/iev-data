  definition: for a tensor of the second order stem:[T = ( T_((i j)) )] and a vector
    *stem:[U]* = (stem:[Uk]), vector the components of which are given by stem:[((
    T * U ))_i = underset(m)( sum ) T_((i m)) U_m]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The inner product of two vectors is their scalar product, because a tensor of
    the first order is considered as a vector.
  - An example is the relation stem:[D = vec vec epsilon * E] between the electric
    field strength *stem:[E]* and the electric flux density *stem:[D]*, where stem:[vec
    vec epsilon] is the absolute permittivity of an anisotropic medium.
  - The inner product of a tensor and a vector is denoted by a half-high dot (Â·) between
    the two symbols.
