data:
  definition: production process of Nb~3~Sn superconducting wires in which islands
    or filaments of Sn or Sn alloy are coprocessed with Nb filaments in a copper matrix
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At final size the wire is heated allowing Sn to diffuse throughout the copper
    matrix forming Nb~3~Sn at the Nb filament interfaces.
