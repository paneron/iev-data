  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:705-01-13}} of an elliptically polarized wave or
    circularly polarized wave for which the {{electric field strength, IEV:121-11-18}}
    vector at a given point in space rotates in the same plane and in an opposite
    sense to that of a reference elliptically polarized wave of the same {{direction
    of propagation, IEV:103-10-05}}, the axial ratios of both {{polarization ellipses,
    IEV:705-01-21}} being the same and their major axes at right angles'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In English, the term “cross polarization” has another connotation (see {{IEV 705-08-52,
    IEV:705-08-52}}).
