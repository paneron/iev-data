data:
  definition: 'measure that expresses the attenuation of the direct illuminance when
    the Sun''s rays cross vertically the pure and dry atmosphere (Rayleigh atmosphere)


    stem:[a_v = ((0,1))/((1 + 0,004 5 m))]


    where stem:[m] is the relative optical air mass weighted to take account of the
    relative spectral transmittance characteristics of the atmosphere'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The luminous extinction coefficient has unit one.
