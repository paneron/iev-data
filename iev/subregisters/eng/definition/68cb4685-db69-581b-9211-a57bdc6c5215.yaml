  definition: coordinates expressing the quotients of each of a set of three <a href="IEV845-23-038">tristimulus
    values</a> and their sum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - As the sum of the three chromaticity coordinates is equal to 1, two of them are
    sufficient to define a chromaticity.
  - In the CIE standard colorimetric systems, the chromaticity coordinates are represented
    by the symbols stem:[x], stem:[y], stem:[z] or stem:[x]~10~, stem:[y]~10~, stem:[z]~10~.
  - The chromaticity coordinates have unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-03-33 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
