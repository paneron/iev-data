  definition: tensor of the third order defined by the trilinear form equal to the
    product of the bilinear form defining a tensor of the second order on a given
    Euclidean space and the linear form identified with a vector in the same space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The components of the tensor product of the tensor stem:[T] and the vector *stem:[U]*
    are: stem:[(( T ox U ))_((i j k)) = T_((i j)) U_k].'
  - The tensor product of a tensor and a vector is denoted by stem:[T ox U].
