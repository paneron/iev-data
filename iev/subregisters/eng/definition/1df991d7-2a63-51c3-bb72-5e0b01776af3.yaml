  definition: measurement of the protective quality of a fabric sample against solar
    <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet radiation</a>, determined by in-vitro testing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For in-vitro testing, the erythemal irradiance measured by a detector with the
    fabric sample under test in place is compared to the erythemal irradiance measured
    with no fabric present, where the source is typically a solar simulator. This
    is expressed as the quotient of the erythemal irradiance without fabric to the
    erythemal irradiance through fabric:


    stem:[F_((UVP)) = ((int_((290\ nm))^((400\ nm)) E_(lambda) s_((er)) ( lambda )
    d lambda))/((int_((290\ nm))^((400\ nm)) E_(lambda) s_((er)) ( lambda ) tau (
    lambda ) d lambda))]


    where stem:[s]~er~(stem:[λ]) is the erythema spectral weighting function, stem:[Eλ]
    is the spectral irradiance, stem:[τ](stem:[λ]) is the measured spectral transmittance
    of the item, and stem:[λ] is the wavelength.'
  - The ultraviolet hazard spectral weighting function, stem:[S]~UV~(stem:[λ]), has
    been substituted for stem:[s]~er~(stem:[λ]) in special instances. If so used,
    the ultraviolet protection factor, stem:[F]~UVP~, has to be noted as stem:[F]~UVP~
    &amp;lsqb;stem:[S](stem:[λ])-weighted&amp;rsqb;.
  - The ultraviolet protection factor has unit one.
