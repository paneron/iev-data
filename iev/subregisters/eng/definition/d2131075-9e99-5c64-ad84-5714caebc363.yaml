  definition: qualifies a physical medium in which the relevant properties depend
    upon direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Whereas in an isotropic medium, linear relation between two vector quantities
    can be described by a scalar quantity, in an anisotropic medium a tensor quantity
    of the second order should be used. Permittivity, permeability, and conductivity,
    are examples of such scalar or tensor quantities.
