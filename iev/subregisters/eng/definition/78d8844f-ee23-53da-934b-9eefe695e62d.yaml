data:
  definition: in a set where an addition is defined, unique element stem:[n], if it
    exists, such that stem:[a] + stem:[n] = stem:[a] for any element stem:[a]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For numbers, the neutral element for addition is the number zero, denoted by 0.
    For vectors, the neutral element is the zero vector, denoted by *0* or stem:[vec
    0]. For matrices, the neutral element is the {{zero matrix, IEV:102-06-07}}. For
    scalar quantities of a given kind, the neutral element is a quantity of the same
    kind, whose numerical value is zero.
