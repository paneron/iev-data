  definition: reciprocal of the coefficient of heat transfer stem:[K], thus stem:[M]
    = 1/stem:[K]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The name “thermal resistance” and the symbol stem:[R] are used in building technology.
    This name and this symbol are normally used for the concept {{113-04-45, IEV:113-04-45}}.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of thermal insulance is square metre kelvin per watt, m^2^·K/W.
