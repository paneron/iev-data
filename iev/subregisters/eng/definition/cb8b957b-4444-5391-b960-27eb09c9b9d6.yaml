  definition: 'quotient of the irradiance or illuminance, stem:[E]~2~ (or stem:[E]~1~),
    at a point on surface S~2~ (or S~1~) due to the flux received from surface S~1~
    (or S~2~) and the radiant exitance or luminous exitance, stem:[M]~1~ (or stem:[M]~2~),
    of surface S~1~ (or S~2~)


    stem:[c_((21)) = ((E_2))/((M_1))]


    or


    stem:[c_((12)) = ((E_1))/((M_2))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The relation between the configuration factor, stem:[c], and the (mutual) exchange
    coefficient, stem:[g], is


    stem:[underset((A_2))( int ) c_((21)) d A_2 = ((underset((A_2))( int ) E_2 d A_2))/((M_1))
    = ((Phi_2))/((M_1)) = g = ((Phi_1))/((M_2)) = ((underset((A_1))( int ) E_1 d A_1))/((M_2))
    = underset((A_1))( int ) c_((12)) d A_1]


    where stem:[Φ]~2~ (or stem:[Φ]~1~) is the flux received over surface S~2~ (or
    S~1~) from surface S~1~ (or S~2~) and stem:[A]~2~ (or stem:[A]~1~) is the area
    of surface S~2~ (or S~1~)'
  - The configuration factor has unit one.
