  definition: 'quotient of the radiance of a surface element in a specified direction,
    stem:[L]~e,n~, and the radiance of the perfect reflecting diffuser or perfect
    transmitting diffuser identically irradiated and viewed, stem:[L]~e,d~


    stem:[beta_e = ((L_((e ,n))))/((L_((e ,d))))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition holds for a surface element of a non-self-radiating medium, in
    a specified direction and under specified conditions of irradiation.
  - Radiance factor is equivalent to reflectance factor or luminance factor when the
    cone angle is infinitely small, and is equivalent to reflectance when the cone
    angle is 2π sr. These quantities are also defined spectrally and called spectral
    radiance factor, stem:[β](stem:[λ]), and spectral reflectance factor, stem:[R](stem:[λ]).
  - The ideal isotropic (Lambertian) diffuser with reflectance or transmittance equal
    to 1 is called a "perfect diffuser".
  - 'For photoluminescent media, the radiance factor contains two components, the
    reflected radiance factor, stem:[β]~R~, and the luminescent radiance factor, stem:[β]~L.~
    The sum of reflected radiance factor and luminescent radiance factor is the total
    radiance factor, stem:[β]~T~: stem:[β]~T~ = stem:[β]~R~ + stem:[β]~L~.


    The subscript R is used here for the reflected radiance factor because it is more
    intuitive than the traditional S and avoids confusion with the use of S to denote
    a state of polarization.'
  - The radiance factor has unit one.
