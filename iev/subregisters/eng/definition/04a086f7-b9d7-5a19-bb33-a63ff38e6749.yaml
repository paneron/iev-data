data:
  definition: the two positions on either side of a standing-wave minimum along a
    slotted line at which the power extracted by the coupling probe is twice the power
    at the minimum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - To more accurately determine very high standing-wave ratios, the mid-point between
    these two points is used to determine the exact position of the minimum and the
    standing wave ratio can be determined from the distance between the two points.
