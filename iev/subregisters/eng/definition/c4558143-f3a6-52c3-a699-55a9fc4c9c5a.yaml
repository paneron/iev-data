  definition: '{{quantity, IEV:112-01-01}} that has the same value under all circumstances'
  examples:
  - '{{speed of light, IEV:113-01-34}} stem:[c]~0~,  {{elementary electric charge,
    IEV:113-05-16}} stem:[e],  {{Planck constant, IEV:113-05-07}} stem:[h].'
  notes:
  - Recommended values of the fundamental physical constants are published by CODATA.
  - Fundamental physical constants are sometimes used as reference quantities to express
    the values of other quantities of the same kind as if they were units of measurement.
    For example, in the field of relativity, it is common practice to express all
    velocities in terms of the speed of light stem:[c]~0~.
