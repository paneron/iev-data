  definition: surface in tristimulus space that represents the locus of colour stimuli
    of zero luminance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The alychne passes through the origin of the space. It intersects any chromaticity
    diagram in a straight line which is also called the alychne; this line lies wholly
    outside the domain of chromaticities bounded by the spectrum locus and the purple
    boundary.
