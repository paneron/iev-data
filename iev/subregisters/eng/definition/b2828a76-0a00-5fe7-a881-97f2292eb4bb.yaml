  definition: process by which gas is evolved or absorbed by an insulating liquid
    when subjected to electric stress of sufficient intensity to cause an electric
    discharge through a gas phase adjacent to a surface of the liquid
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Gassing test results are expressed either as a volume or a rate. Conventionally
    the value is positive if gas is evolved during the test, negative if gas is absorbed.
