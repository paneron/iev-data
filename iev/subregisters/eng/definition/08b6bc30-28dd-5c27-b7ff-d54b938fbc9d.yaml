  definition: 'angle the tangent of which is the ratio of the resistance stem:[R]
    to the absolute value of the reactance stem:[X] of an impedance


    stem:[delta = a r c t a n (R)/((| X |))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The loss angle is defined in {{151-15-48, IEV:151-15-48}} as the angle the tangent
    of which is the dissipation factor, or ratio of active power to the absolute value
    of reactive power. Other loss angles are defined in electromagnetism (see {{121-12-17,
    IEV:121-12-17}} and {{121-12-35, IEV:121-12-35}}).
