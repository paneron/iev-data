  definition: system for determining the <a href="IEV845-23-038">tristimulus values</a>
    of any spectral power distribution using the set of reference colour stimuli &amp;lsqb;X&amp;rsqb;,
    &amp;lsqb;Y&amp;rsqb;, &amp;lsqb;Z&amp;rsqb; and the three CIE colour-matching
    functions stem:[bar x ( lambda ) , bar y ( lambda ) , bar z ( lambda )] adopted
    by the CIE in 1931
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[bar y ( lambda )] is identical to stem:[V](stem:[λ]) and hence the tristimulus
    values stem:[Y] are proportional to values of luminance.
  - The CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system is applicable to centrally viewed fields
    of angular subtense between about 1° and about 4° (0,017 rad and 0,07 rad).
  - The CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system can be derived from the CIE 1931 RGB
    colorimetric system using a transformation based on a set of three linear equations.
    The CIE 1931 RGB system is based on three real monochromatic reference stimuli.
  - See also CIE 15, stem:[Colorimetry].
