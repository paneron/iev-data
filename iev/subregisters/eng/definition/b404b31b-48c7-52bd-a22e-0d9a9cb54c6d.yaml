  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'An stem:[n]-dimensional vector is represented by an ordered set of stem:[n] scalars,
    usually real or complex numbers, which depend on the choice of the base. In matrix
    notation, these scalars are usually represented as a column matrix:


    stem:[U = ( [[U_1],[U_2],[vdots],[U_n]] )]'
  - A vector in a Euclidean space is characterized by its {{magnitude, IEV:102-03-23}}
    and, if it is a non-zero vector, by its {{direction, IEV:102-03-12}}.
  - "A complex vector *stem:[U]* is defined by a real part and an imaginary part:\
    \ \nstem:[U = A + j B] where *stem:[A]* and *stem:[B]* are real vectors."
  - 'A vector is indicated by a letter symbol in sloped boldface type or by an arrow
    above a sloped lightface letter symbol: *stem:[U]* or stem:[vec U]. The vector
    *stem:[U]* with components stem:[U_i] can be denoted stem:[( U_i )].'
  - The term "vector" is also used for a {{vector quantity, IEV:102-03-21}}.
  - In geometry, the term “vector” is often used for a directed line segment in a
    {{point space, IEV:102-03-02}}.
