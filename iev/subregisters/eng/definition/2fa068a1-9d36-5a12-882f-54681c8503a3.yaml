  definition: 'imaginary part of an impedance stem:[R = Re ( underset(_)(Z) )]


    stem:[X = Im ( underset(_)(Z) )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reactance of a series-resonant circuit is stem:[X = omega L - (1)/((omega
    C))], where stem:[L] is inductance, stem:[C] is capacitance, and stem:[Ï‰] is angular
    frequency.
