  definition: the difference between the basic transmission loss and the free-space
    basic transmission loss, expressed in decibels
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Loss relative to free space may be divided into losses of different types, such
    as:


    - absorption loss, for example by ionospheric, atmospheric gases or hydrometeors;


    - diffraction loss, as for ground waves;


    - effective reflection or scattering loss as in the ionospheric case including
    the results of any ionospheric focussing or defocussing;


    - polarization coupling loss, which can arise from any polarization mismatch between
    the antennas for the particular ray path considered;


    - antenna gain degradation, as in tropospheric scatter propagation;


    - losses due to phase interference between the direct ray and rays reflected from
    the ground, other obstacles or atmospheric layers.'
