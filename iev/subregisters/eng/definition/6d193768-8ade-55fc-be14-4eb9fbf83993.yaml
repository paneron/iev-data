  definition: measure of the probability of a nuclear reaction of a specific type,
    stated as the effective area which target particles present to incident particles
    for that process
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The standard unit for measuring a nuclear cross-section is the barn, which is
    equal to 10^−28^ m^2^ or 10^−24^ cm^2^.
  - A microscopic cross-section can be measured for each process of nuclear reaction
    (capture, fission, n-n′, n-2n, n-g, …..).
  - The macroscopic cross-section allows the calculation of the number of interactions
    for a given nuclear reaction in a given material; this value is the produce between
    the corresponding cross-section and the volumic number of particles in this material;
    it is expressed in m^−1^ or cm^−1^.
