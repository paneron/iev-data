  definition: '{{electromagnetic field, IEV:121-11-61}} such that, in at least one
    direction, each component of one of the vectors of the field has the same {{phase,
    IEV:103-07-04}} at the same time at all points and an {{amplitude, IEV:103-07-02}}
    that decreases very rapidly to negligible values at a few {{wavelengths, IEV:103-10-10}},
    where this decrease is not due to {{absorption, IEV:705-02-07}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An evanescent field does not propagate energy and is, consequently, not a {{wave,
    IEV:103-10-01}}.
