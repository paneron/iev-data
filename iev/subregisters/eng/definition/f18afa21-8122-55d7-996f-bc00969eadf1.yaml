  definition: 'quotient of transmitted radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~t~, and incident radiant
    flux, stem:[Φ]~m~


    stem:[tau = ((Phi_t))/((Phi_m))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Transmittance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, stem:[α] + stem:[ρ] + stem:[τ] = 1 except when <a
    href="IEV845-21-017">polarized radiation</a> is observed, where stem:[α] is absorptance
    and stem:[ρ] is reflectance.
  - 'Transmittance, stem:[τ], is the sum of regular transmittance, stem:[τ]~r~, and
    diffuse transmittance, stem:[τ]~d~: stem:[τ] = stem:[τ]~r~ + stem:[τ]~d~.'
  - The transmittance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-59 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
