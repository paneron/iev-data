data:
  definition: 'those quantities the numerical values of which define the tapping duty.The
    tapping quantities include for each winding and for each tapping:


    a) a tapping voltage,


    b) a tapping power,


    c) a tapping current'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Tapping quantities are related to a given tapping connection of the transformer
    and apply therefore to any winding, including any untapped winding.
