  definition: 'macroscopic quantum effect in which, when a direct current (DC) voltage
    stem:[U] is applied across a Josephson junction, an alternating current of Cooper
    pairs flows by tunnel effect through the junction, generating the emission of
    electromagnetic wave having a frequency stem:[f] proportional to the applied voltage
    and satisfying the relation:


    stem:[f] = stem:[2eU/h]


    where stem:[h] is the Planck constant and stem:[e] is the elementary electric
    charge'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The AC Josephson effect also manifests itself conversely so that, when a Josephson
    junction is irradiated by an electromagnetic radiation of frequency stem:[f,]
    the voltage across it can assume quantized values equal to (stem:[h]/2stem:[e])stem:[nf],
    where stem:[n] is an integer.
  - stem:[f/U] = 483,6 MHz/Î¼V.
