data:
  definition: time interval between the instants at which the magnitude of the pulse
    at the output terminals reaches specified lower and upper limits respectively
    when the semiconductor device is being switched from its non-conducting to its
    conducting state
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The lower and upper limits are usually 10 % and 90 % respectively of the final
    amplitude of the output pulse.
