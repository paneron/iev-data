data:
  definition: discrete frequency spectral components, non-harmonically related to
    the desired output frequency, appearing at the output terminal of an oscillator
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These components may appear as symmetrical sidebands or as signal spectral components,
    depending upon the mode of generation. Spurious components in the output spectrum
    are usually expressed as a power ratio (in decibels) with respect to the output
    signal power.
