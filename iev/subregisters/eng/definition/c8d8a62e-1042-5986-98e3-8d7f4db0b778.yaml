  definition: 'density of exiting luminous flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[M_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~v~ is luminous flux and stem:[A] is the area from which the luminous
    flux leaves'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Luminous exitance can be derived from the spectral radiant exitance distribution
    by


    stem:[M_v = K_m int_0^(oo) M_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[M]~e,~stem:[λ](stem:[λ])
    is the spectral radiant exitance at wavelength stem:[λ] and stem:[V](stem:[λ])
    is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>.


    Integral limits can be confined depending on the spectral <a href="IEV845-25-061">responsivity</a>
    of the detectors used as a sensor.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exitance". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exitance".
  - The luminous exitance is expressed in lumen per square metre (lm·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-48 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
