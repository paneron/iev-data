  definition: 'for a complex matrix *stem:[A]* with elements stem:[Aij], matrix denoted
    by *stem:[A]** the elements (*stem:[A]**)~stem:[ij]~ of which are the conjugates
    of the elements of the given matrix: stem:[(( A^( * ) ))_((i j)) = A_(i j)^( *
    )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The complex conjugate matrix of a matrix *stem:[A]* is denoted by *stem:[A]**.
    The notation stem:[bar A] is also used in mathematics.
