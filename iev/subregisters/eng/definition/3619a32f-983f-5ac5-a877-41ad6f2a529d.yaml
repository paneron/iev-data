  definition: 'one of the following two quotients:


    a) for transduction of an electric signal into an acoustic signal, quotient of
    the resulting sound pressure in the blocked acoustical system by the excitation
    voltage in the electrical system;


    b) for transduction of an acoustic signal into an electric signal, quotient of
    the resulting short-circuit current in the electrical system by the excitation
    volume velocity in the acoustical system'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These definitions are best applied to a reciprocal electroacoustic transducer
    with transformer coupling, for example an electrostatic or piezoelectric transducer,
    in which case the two quotients have equal magnitude.
