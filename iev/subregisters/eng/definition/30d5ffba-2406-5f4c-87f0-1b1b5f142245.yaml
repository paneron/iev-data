  notes:
  - 'For homogeneous rain precipitation, the radar reflectivity factor is given by
    the expression:


    stem:[Z = ((sum N_i D_i^6))/(V)]


    where stem:[N]~stem:[i]~ is the number of particles of diameter stem:[D]~stem:[i]~
    in a volume stem:[V]. The factor stem:[Z] is generally expressed in mm^6^/m^3^.'
