    behaviour
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The voltage to be stated and the conditions to be prescribed are dealt with in
    the relevant publications.
  - For switching devices, the breaking capacity may be termed according to the kind
    of current included in the prescribed conditions, e.g. line-charging breaking
    capacity, cable charging breaking capacity, single capacitor bank breaking capacity,
    etc.
