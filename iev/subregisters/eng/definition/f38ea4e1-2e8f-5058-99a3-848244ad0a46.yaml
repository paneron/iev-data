  definition: 'scalar potential stem:[V] of the irrotational vector stem:[( E + ((del
    A))/((del t)) )], where stem:[*E*] is the electric field strength, stem:[*A*]
    is a magnetic vector potential and stem:[t] is the time:


    stem:[- grad V = E + ((del A))/((del t))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric potential is not unique since any constant scalar quantity can be
    added to a given electric potential without changing its gradient.
