  definition: principle that the time response to the sum of several input variables
    is the same as the sum of the time responses caused by the individual input variables
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The principle of superposition includes the special case, that at multiplication
    of an input variable by a constant factor the accompanying time response is multiplied
    by the same factor (often called “principle of amplification”).
