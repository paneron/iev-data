  definition: for each station of a radio link using ionospheric reflection, the point
    in a layer whose projection on the surface of the Earth is at a specified distance
    from the station on the great circle arc joining it to the second station when
    the length of this arc is greater than twice the specified distance. When this
    length is less than twice the specified distance, the control points are coincident
    at a point vertically above the mid-point of the great circle arc
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For reflection from the E and F2 layers, the specified distance is generally chosen
    as 1000 km and 2000 km respectively.
