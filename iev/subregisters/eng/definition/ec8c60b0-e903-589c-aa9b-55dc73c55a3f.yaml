  definition: the wave impedance for a travelling wave in a specific medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The characteristic impedance of a homogeneous isotropic medium is given by:


    stem:[Z_i = sqrt(((mu_0 (underset(_)(mu))_r))/((epsilon_0 (underset(_)(epsilon))_r)))]


    where


    stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant,


    stem:[μ]~r~ is the relative complex permeability,


    stem:[ε]~0~ is the electric constant,


    stem:[ε]~r~ is the relative complex permittivity.'
