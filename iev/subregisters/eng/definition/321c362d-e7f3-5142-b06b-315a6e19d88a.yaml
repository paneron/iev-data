  notes:
  - Measurement does not apply to nominal properties.
  - Measurement implies comparison of quantities, including counting of entities.
  - 'The French word "mesure" has several meanings in everyday French language. It
    is for this reason that the French word "mesurage" has been introduced to describe
    the act of measurement. Nevertheless, the French word "mesure" occurs many times
    in forming terms, following current usage, and without ambiguity. Examples are:
    unité de mesure (unit of measurement), méthode de mesure (measurement method),
    instrument de mesure (measurement instrument). This does not mean that the use
    of the French word "mesurage" in place of "mesure" in such terms is not permissible
    when advantageous.'
