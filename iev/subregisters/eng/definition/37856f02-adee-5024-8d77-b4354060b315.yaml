  definition: qualifying a time-varying phenomenon, a {{timescale, IEV:702-04-11}}
    or a {{signal, IEV:701-01-02}} the consecutive {{significant instants, IEV:704-13-03}}
    of which are separated by {{time intervals, IEV:113-01-10}} which are not all
    constrained to have the same rated {{duration, IEV:113-01-13}} or to have rated
    durations equal to integral multiples of a unit duration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “asynchronous” with a different meaning is used in the technique of rotating
    machines (see for example {{IEV 411-31-09, IEV:411-31-09}} “asynchronous machine").
