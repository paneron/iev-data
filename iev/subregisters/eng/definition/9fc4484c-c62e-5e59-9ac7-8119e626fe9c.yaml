  definition: of an electroacoustic transducer for sound emission, for a specified
    frequency, quotient of the time-mean-square sound pressure in a free field at
    a specified distance from the effective acoustic centre of the transducer, and
    in a specified direction, by the electric power input
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the effective acoustic centre of the transducer cannot be easily determined,
    the distance is measured from the reference point of the transducer.
