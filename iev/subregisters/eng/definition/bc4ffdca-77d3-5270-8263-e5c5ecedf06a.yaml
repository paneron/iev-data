  definition: complex quantity representing a real quantity which varies sinusoidally
    with time (such as sound pressure, vibration velocity, voltage), or the quotient
    of two such complex quantities of the same frequency, which can be expressed in
    the form (stem:[a]+stem:[jb]) with real part stem:[a] and imaginary part stem:[b],
    or as a phasor Ae ^stem:[j]θ^ with modulus stem:[A] and argument θ
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Throughout this section, all parameters (mechanical, acoustic, or electric) are
    considered to be complex, unless specified otherwise.
  - The convention of +stem:[j] is observed here, whereby a positive-going sine wave
    is represented by stem:[Re](stem:[e] ^stem:[j](ωstem:[t]-stem:[kx])^) a mass reactance
    by +stem:[j]ωstem:[M], and a stiffness reactance by -stem:[jS]/ω. Wave number
    stem:[k] = ω/stem:[c] is the quotient of angular frequency ω by speed of sound
    stem:[c]; mass stem:[M]; stiffness stem:[S].
