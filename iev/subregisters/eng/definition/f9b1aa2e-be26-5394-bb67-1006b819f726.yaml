  definition: phenomenon in which superconductivity is weakened or degraded at a grain
    boundary with a certain degree of structural and/or chemical disorder
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A grain boundary weak link is frequently observed for high temperature superconductors
    with short coherence length. Such a weak link is readily changed to a resistive
    state when excess magnetic field or current is applied.
