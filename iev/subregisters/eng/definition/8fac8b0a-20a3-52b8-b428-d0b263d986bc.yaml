  definition: 'ratio of the absolute value of the mutual permeance stem:[Λij] related
    to two circuit elements stem:[i] and stem:[j] to the geometric average of their
    self-permeances stem:[Λii] and stem:[Λjj]


    stem:[k_((i j)) = ((| Lambda_(( i j)) |))/((sqrt(Lambda_(( i i)) Lambda_((j j)))))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The inductive coupling factor can also be expressed as


    stem:[k_((i j)) = ((| L_(( i j)) |))/((sqrt(L_(( i i)) L_((j j)))))]


    where stem:[Lii] and stem:[Ljj] are the self-inductances of the elements and stem:[Lij]
    their mutual inductance.'
