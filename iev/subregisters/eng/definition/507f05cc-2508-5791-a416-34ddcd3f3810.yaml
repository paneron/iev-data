  definition: 'for a linear two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit, under sinusoidal
    conditions, quantity equal to the product of the apparent power stem:[S] and the
    sine of the displacement angle stem:[φ]


    stem:[Q = S sin phi]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reactive power is the imaginary part of the complex power stem:[underset(_)(S)],
    thus stem:[Q = Im underset(_)(S)]. Its absolute value is equal to the non-active
    power, thus stem:[| Q | = Q_( ∼ )].
  - The coherent SI unit for reactive power is voltampere, VA. The special name var
    and its symbol var are also used. See {{131-11-45, IEV:131-11-45}}.
