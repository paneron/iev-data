  definition: at a given location of a three-phase system, and for a given system
    configuration, ratio of the highest rms value of line-to-earth power frequency
    voltage on a healthy line conductor during an earth fault affecting one or more
    line conductors at any point on the system, to the rms value of line-to-earth
    power frequency voltage which would be obtained at the given location in the absence
    of any such earth fault
