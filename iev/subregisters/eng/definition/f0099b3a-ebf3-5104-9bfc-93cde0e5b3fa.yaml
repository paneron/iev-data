  definition: the number of bound modes that an optical fibre is capable of supporting
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For stem:[V]&lt; 2.405 step index fibre can only support one mode as is the case
    for singlemode fibre.
  - For stem:[V]&gt; 5, approximately given by, stem:[V] ^2^/2 and (stem:[V] ^2^/2)
    [g/(g + 2)], for step index and power-law profile fibres, respectively, where
    g is the profile parameter, and stem:[V] is the normalized frequency.
