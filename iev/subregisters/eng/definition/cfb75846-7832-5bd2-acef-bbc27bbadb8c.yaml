data:
  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the mass density stem:[ρ] of a substance
    divided by the mass density stem:[ρ]~0~ of a reference substance, under conditions
    that should be specified for both substances, thus stem:[d] = stem:[ρ]/stem:[ρ]~0~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For stem:[ρ]~0~, the mass density of liquid water at 4 °C (1 000 kg/m^3^) is often
    used.
