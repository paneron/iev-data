  definition: 'perturbed state wherein the system, even when not disturbed, will not
    remain in a {{steady state, IEV:692-02-01}}, or cannot spontaneously return to
    a {{steady state, IEV:692-02-01}} after being subjected to a {{disturbance, IEV:692-01-09}}
    of prescribed magnitude

  - In an unstable state, the {{electric power system, IEV:692-01-02}} is experiencing
    {{cascade tripping, IEV:692-03-08}}, voltage instability or other instability
    likely to result in {{system collapse, IEV:692-01-17}}.
