  definition: "for a given set of {{scalars, IEV:102-02-18}}, set of elements for\
    \ which the sum of any two elements *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* and the product\
    \ of any element and a scalar stem:[α] are elements of the set, with the following\
    \ properties:\n\n\n\n* stem:[U + V = V + U],\n\n* stem:[( U + V ) + W = U + (\
    \ V + W )], where *stem:[W]* is also an element of the set, \n\n* there exists\
    \ a neutral element for addition, called zero vector and denoted by *0*, such\
    \ that: stem:[U + 0 = U],\n\n* there exists an opposite stem:[( - U )] such that\
    \ stem:[U + ( - U ) = 0],\n\n* stem:[( alpha + beta ) U = alpha U + beta U], where\
    \ stem:[β] is also a scalar, \n\n* stem:[alpha ( U + V ) = alpha U + alpha V],\n\
    \n* stem:[alpha ( beta U ) = ( alpha beta ) U],\n\n* stem:[1 U = U]"

  notes:
  - In the usual three-dimensional space, the directed line segments with a specified
    origin form an example of a vector space over real numbers. Another example, corresponding
    to the extended concept of scalar (see {{IEV 102-02-18, IEV:102-02-18}}, Note
    1) is the set of stem:[n-]bit words formed of the digits 0 and 1 with addition
    modulo two, where the set of scalars is the set of two elements 0 and 1 subject
    to Boolean algebra.
