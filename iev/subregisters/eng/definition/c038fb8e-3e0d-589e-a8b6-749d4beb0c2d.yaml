  definition: for a magnetic circuit constructed of different materials or non-homogeneous
    materials or both, the permeability of a hypothetical homogeneous material which,
    when used to construct a circuit of identical dimensions, would provide the same
    reluctance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Where the different materials are in series along the magnetic path and the permeability
    can be assumed constant over any cross-section, the following equation is applicable:


    stem:[(1)/((mu_e)) sum (l)/(A) = sum (l)/((mu_r A))]


    where stem:[l] is the length, measured along the magnetic path, of each part of
    the core of uniform cross-section stem:[A] and homogeneous permeability stem:[Âµ]~r~.'
  - The effective permeability is used particularly in relation to cores having (air)
    gaps and it is usually restricted to cases where the leakage flux is relatively
    small.
