  definition: 'one of the three symmetrical sequence components which exists in symmetrical
    and unsymmetrical three-phase system(s) of sinusoidal quantities and which is
    defined by the following complex mathematical expression:


    stem:[X]~1~ = 1/3(stem:[X]~L1~ + stem:[aX]~L2~ + stem:[a]^2^stem:[X]~L3~)


    where stem:[a] is the 120 degree operator, and stem:[X]~L1~, stem:[X]~L2~ and
    stem:[X]~L3~ are the complex expressions of the phase quantities concerned, and
    where stem:[X] denotes the system current or voltage phasors'
