data:
  definition: the time expressed in angular measure by which the trigger pulse is
    delayed with respect to the reference instant in the case of phase control
  examples: []
  notes:
  - With line, machine or load commutated converters the reference instant is the
    zero crossing instant of the commutating voltage. With AC controllers it is the
    zero crossing instant of the supply voltage. For AC controllers with inductive
    loads the trigger delay angle is the sum of the phase shift and the current delay
    angle.
