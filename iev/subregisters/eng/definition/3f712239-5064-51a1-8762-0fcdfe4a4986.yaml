      modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: 'quantitative measure of {{information, IEV:171-07-03}} about the occurrence
    of an event stem:[x] of definite probability stem:[p](stem:[x]), equal to the
    logarithm of the reciprocal of this probability


    stem:[I ( x ) = log (1)/((p ( x ))) = - log p ( x )]'
  examples:
  - 'Let stem:[{ a , b , c }] be a set of three events and let stem:[p ( a ) = 0,5],
    stem:[p ( b ) = 0,25] and stem:[p ( c ) = 0,25] be the probabilities of their
    occurrences. The information contents of these events are: stem:[I ( a ) = lb
    (1)/((0,50)) Sh = 1 Sh], stem:[I ( b ) = lb (1)/((0,25)) Sh = 2 Sh], stem:[I (
    c ) = lb (1)/((0,25)) Sh = 2 Sh].'
  notes:
  - For a set of equiprobable events, the information content of each event is equal
    to the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}} of the set.
