  definition: vector potential of the magnetic flux density
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The rotation of the magnetic vector potential stem:[*A*]  is the magnetic flux
    density stem:[*B*]:


    *rot*stem:[*A*] = stem:[*B*]'
  - The magnetic vector potential is not unique since any irrotational vector field
    quantity can be added to a given magnetic vector potential without changing its
    rotation. Under static conditions the magnetic vector potential is often chosen
    so that its divergence is zero.
