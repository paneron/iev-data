  definition: a system for use with frequency-modulated transmitters for stereophonic
    broadcasting, in which the modulating signal of the main carrier is a multiplexed
    signal comprising a pre-emphasized  sum signal, a double-sideband suppressed carrier
    amplitude modulated by a pre-emphasized difference signal, and a pilot-tone which
    allows stereophonic receivers to recover the difference signal
