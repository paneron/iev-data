  definition: "shortest distance or the sum of the shortest distances along the surface\
    \ on an insulator between two conductive parts which normally have the operating\
    \ voltage between them\r\n<note surface of cement or any other non-insulating\
    \ jointing material is not considered as forming part the creepage distance.></note>"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If a high resistance coating is applied to parts of the insulating part of an
    insulator, such parts are considered to be effective insulating surfaces and the
    distance over them is included in the creepage distance.
