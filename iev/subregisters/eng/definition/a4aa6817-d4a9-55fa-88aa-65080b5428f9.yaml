  definition: process or device by which the {{gain, IEV:702-02-11}} of an {{amplifier,
    IEV:151-13-50}} is controlled by the level of the {{output, IEV:151-15-14}} {{signal,
    IEV:101-12-02}} so as to reduce changes in this level as compared with the changes
    in the {{input, IEV:151-15-13}} signal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Frequently, automatic gain control is used to keep the output signal level nearly
    constant.
