    given duration or a given number of events
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Events are usually failures, but, in a maintainability test, the events would
    be restorations.
  - A test terminated when there are still unfailed items may be called a â€œcensored
    test", and test duration data from such a test referred to as censored data.
