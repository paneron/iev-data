  definition: scalar field stem:[U] the negative of the gradient of which is a force
    field *stem:[F]*, thus *stem:[F]* = −*grad* stem:[U]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The potential is not unique since any constant scalar field can be added to
    a given potential without changing its gradient. See also IEC 60050-102:2007,
    {{102-05-24, IEV:102-05-24}}.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of potential is newton metre, N⋅m.
