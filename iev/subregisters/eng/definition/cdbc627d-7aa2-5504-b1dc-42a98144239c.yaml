  definition: the relative permeability obtained from the peak-to-valley value of
    the magnetic flux density and the peak-to-valley value of the applied magnetic
    field strength, at a stated amplitude of either, when the field strength is varying
    periodically with time about a specified static value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The notes following the definition of amplitude permeability apply to this definition
    also.
  - The incremental permeability depends on the way in which the magnetic material
    was brought to its static value of field strength. The definition implies that
    the alternating and static field are collinear ; if they are not, the permeability
    becomes a tensor quantity.
