  definition: physical arrangement of contiguous detector elements to sense locally
    resolved signals
  examples:
  - CCD array, photodiode array, CMOS array.
  notes:
  - A typical application of an array detector is to sense the local resolved output
    of a polychromator.
  - In some cases, optical components can form a part of the array as in, for example,
    a fibre optics faceplate coupled array detector.
