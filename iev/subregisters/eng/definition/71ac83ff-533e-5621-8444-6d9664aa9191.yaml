  definition: in the “standard model” of particles, one of six elementary particles
    combined in triples or in pairs with an antiparticle to constitute other particles
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '1 The six types of quarks have names (called flavours): down (d), up (u), strange
    (s), charm (c), bottom (b) and top (t). They are fermions, bearing an electric
    charge equal to +2/3 or −1/3 elementary charge. Each quark has an antiparticle
    denoted by overlining its symbol.'
  - 2 Quarks never occur isolated but only in combination, either in triplets such
    as neutron, proton or hyperons, or in pairs with antiquarks, as mesons. Quarks
    are the source of a short-distance strong interaction, which explains in particular
    the cohesion of atomic nuclei.
