  definition: mean value of photon irradiance on the outer curved surface of a very
    small (real or imaginary) sphere at a point in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The photon spherical irradiance can be expressed by


    stem:[E_((p ,o)) = underset((4 pi))( int ) L_p d omega]


    where stem:[Ω] is solid angle and stem:[L]~p~ is photon radiance.'
  - The photon spherical irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one
    per square metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
