  definition: 'r.m.s. values of the current at the rated supply voltage and at the
    highest value of the secondary voltage setting, the electrodes being short-circuited
    according to specified test conditions and the machine being arranged so as to
    have successively:


    a) minimum impedance corresponding to the minimum throat depth and gap;


    b) maximum impedance corresponding to the maximum throat depth and gap.'
