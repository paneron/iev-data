  definition: a surface wave guided along the plane surface separating a medium with
    finite conductivity from a perfect dielectric medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This concept was introduced by Zenneck in order to represent the propagation of
    radio waves of relatively long wavelengths in the immediate vicinity of the surface
    of the Earth and at a great distance from the transmission point.
