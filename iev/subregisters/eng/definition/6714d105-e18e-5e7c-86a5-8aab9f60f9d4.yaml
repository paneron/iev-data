  definition: for a sinusoidal wave at a given point, velocity in the direction of
    propagation of the wavefront corresponding to a specified phase
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The magnitude of the phase velocity is equal to the product of frequency and wavelength,
    and to the quotient of angular frequency by angular wavenumber.
  - If both phase velocities and other velocities are involved, then stem:[c] should
    be used for the former and stem:[v] (vee) for the latter.
