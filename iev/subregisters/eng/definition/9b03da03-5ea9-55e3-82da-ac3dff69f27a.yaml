data:
  definition: a domain wall in which the orientation of the magnetic moment varies
    through the wall and remains in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the wall
  examples: []
  notes:
  - NÃ©el walls are normally formed only in thin magnetic films below a critical thickness
    ; in thicker films and in bulk materials the formation of Bloch walls is energetically
    more favourable.
