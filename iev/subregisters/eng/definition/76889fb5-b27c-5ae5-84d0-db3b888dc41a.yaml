  definition: complex quantity stem:[underset(_)(gamma) = alpha + j beta] appearing
    in the complex representation of a wave stem:[A_0 exp ( - underset(_)(gamma) x
    + j omega t + j vartheta_0 )], where its real part stem:[A_0 exp ( - alpha x )
    cos ( - beta x + omega t + vartheta_0 )] represents, along a line parallel to
    the stem:[x]-axis, a characteristic quantity of a guided sinusoidal wave or a
    plane sinusoidal wave, at angular frequency stem:[Ï‰] and initial phase stem:[vartheta_0]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept of propagation coefficient has a meaning only when stem:[A_0] and
    stem:[underset(_)(gamma)] are substantially independent of stem:[x.]
  - The propagation coefficient has the dimension of reciprocal length and is usually
    a function of frequency.
