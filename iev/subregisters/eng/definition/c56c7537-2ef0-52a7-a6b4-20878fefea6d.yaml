  definition: 'for a linear time-invariant system with a sinusoidal input variable
    in steady state of the output variable the ratio of the phasor of the output variable
    to the phasor of the corresponding input variable, represented as a function of
    the angular frequency stem:[Ï‰]


    SEE: Figures 9 and 10.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The frequency response coincides with the transfer function taken on the imaginary
    axis of the complex plane.
