data:
  definition: a radiation detector using a photoluminescent substance (for instance
    silver phosphate glass) which, on excitation by radiation of certain wavelengths
    (e.g., ultra-violet radiation for silver phosphate), emits a luminous radiation
    of a different wavelength, generally in the visible spectrum, the magnitude of
    which is a function of the energy stored in the detector during its exposure to
    ionizing radiation
