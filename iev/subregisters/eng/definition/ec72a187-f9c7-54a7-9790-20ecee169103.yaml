  definition: 'protection, generally distance protection, using telecommunication,
    with underreach protection at each section end and in which a signal is transmitted
    when a fault is detected by the underreach protection. Receipt of the signal at
    the other end initiates tripping if other local permissive protection at the other
    end has detected the fault
