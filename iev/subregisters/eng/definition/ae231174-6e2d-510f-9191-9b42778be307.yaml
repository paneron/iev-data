  definition: scalar quantity equal to the scalar line integral of a force *stem:[F]*
    acting on a particle along a given path C, thus stem:[W] &amp;equals; ∫~C~ *stem:[F]* ⋅ d*stem:[r]*,
    where d*stem:[r]* is vector line element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Work is energy transferred in a special manner and thus is a process quantity
    ({{113-04-10, IEV:113-04-10}}). Work stem:[W] changes the internal energy stem:[E]
    ({{113-04-20, IEV:113-04-20}}) of a body for Δstem:[E] = stem:[W], where stem:[E]
    is a state quantity ({{113-04-09, IEV:113-04-09}}).
  - '2 In applications, work is often calculated as the time integral of power stem:[P]:
    stem:[W = int_(t_1)^(t_2) P d t].'
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of work is joule, J.
