  definition: area of a surface having a sound power absorption coefficient of unity
    that would absorb the same amount of sound power in a reverberant room with a
    diffuse sound field as the object or the surface. In the саге of a surface, the
    equivalent absorption area is the product of the area of the surface and its sound
    power absorption coefficient
