data:
  definition: portion of the spectral response curve corresponding to the total absorption
    of photon energy in a radiation detector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This peak represents the total absorption of photon energy from all interactive
    processes, namely, a) photoelectric absorption, b) Compton effect, and c) pair
    production.
