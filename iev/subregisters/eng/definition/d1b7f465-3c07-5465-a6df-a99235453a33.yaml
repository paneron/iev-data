  definition: 'quotient step response Δstem:[v]~ε~(stem:[t]) divided by the step height
    stem:[K]~ε~ of the step function, the quotient described by


    stem:[h ( t ) = (1)/((K_(epsilon))) . Delta v_(epsilon) ( t )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The unit-step response may be calculated from the unit-impulse response by


    stem:[h ( t ) = int_((- oo))^t g ( tau ) d tau].'
  - The unit-step response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit step to an input variable.
