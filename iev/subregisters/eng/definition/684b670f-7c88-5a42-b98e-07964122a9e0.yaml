  definition: direct frequency converter
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By creating an alternating voltage from successive waves of the higher frequency
    AC system the cycloconverter provides a lower output frequency.
  - 'By creating an alternating voltage from successive voltage samples of suitable
    frequency and duration the cycloconverter provides a higher or lower output frequency.
