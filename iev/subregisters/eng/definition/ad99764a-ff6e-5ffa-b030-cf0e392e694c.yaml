  definition: 'one of a set of linearly independent vectors, the sum of which is equal
    to a given vector


    EXAMPLE




    * for a given vector stem:[U = U_1 a_1 + U_2 a_2 + ... + U_n a_n], where stem:[U_1
    , U_2 , ... , U_n] are the coordinates of *stem:[U]* and stem:[a_1 , a_2 , ...
    , a_n] are the base vectors, any of the vectors stem:[U_1 a_1 , U_2 a_2 , ...
    , U_n a_n],


    * the projections of a vector normal and tangential to a surface (normal component
    and tangential component).'

  notes:
  - In English, the term "component vector" may be used if "component" is used in
    the sense of "coordinate" (see Note 2 to entry in {{IEV 102-03-09, IEV:102-03-09}}).
