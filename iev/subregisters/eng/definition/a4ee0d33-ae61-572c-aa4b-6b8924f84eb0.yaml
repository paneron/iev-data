  definition: general principle that, in the absence of losses, the elementary radiant
    flux or luminous flux, dstem:[Φ], between two elementary areas dstem:[A] and dstem:[A]′
    defining an elementary beam is proportional to the elementary projected areas
    dstem:[A] cos stem:[θ] and dstem:[A]′ cos stem:[θ] ′ in the direction of the beam
    and inversely proportional to the squared distance, stem:[l], between the areas
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The basic law of radiometry and photometry is expressed by


    stem:[d Phi = L * ((d A cos theta * d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' )))/((l^2))]


    where the proportionality factor for this geometrical condition is equal to the
    radiance or luminance, respectively, within the elementary beam.'
  - The basic law of radiometry and photometry is based on the geometric extent.
