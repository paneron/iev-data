  definition: inflammatory response of the cornea and conjunctiva following exposure
    to <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet radiation</a>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Wavelengths shorter than 320 nm are most effective in causing photokeratoconjunctivitis.
    The peak of the action spectrum is at approximately 270 nm.
  - Different action spectra have been published for photokeratitis and photoconjuctivitis
    (CIE 106/2-1993 and CIE 106/3-1993); however, the latest studies support the use
    of a single action spectrum for both ocular effects (CIE 106/1-1993). See CIE
    106-1993, _CIE Collection in Photobiology and Photochemistry (1993)._
