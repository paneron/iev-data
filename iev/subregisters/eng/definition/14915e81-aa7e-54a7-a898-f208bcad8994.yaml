  definition: 'for two tensors of the second-order stem:[T = ( T_((i j)) )] and stem:[S
    = ( S_((k l)) )], scalar defined by stem:[T : S = underset((m n))( sum ) T_((m
    n)) S_((n m))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The scalar product of two tensors is denoted by a colon (:) between the two symbols
    of the tensors.
