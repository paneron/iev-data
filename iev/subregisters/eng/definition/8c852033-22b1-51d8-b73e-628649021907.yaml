  definition: difference between the increase of the total energy of a physical system
    and the work done on the system, provided that matter and electromagnetic energy
    do not cross the boundary of the system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quantity of heat depends on how the change from one state to another has been
    obtained and is only partly transformable into work.
  - A supply of heat may correspond to an increase of the energy related to the motions
    of particles or to other effects such as phase changes.
