  definition: particle with half-integer spin quantum number, i.e. 1/2, 3/2, ...
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Fermions undergo Fermi-Dirac statistics and obey the Pauli exclusion principle,
    which asserts that only a single particle can be assigned to a given quantum state.
  - 2 Fermions are e.g. the electron, all neutrinos and quarks, and all particles
    constituted from an odd number of fermions (e.g., proton, neutron, helium nucleus
    ^3^He).
