  definition: modulation which may be considered either as a modulation on two carriers
    in quadrature by time shifted digital signals obtained from the elements of even
    or odd rank of the modulating digital signal, or as an amplitude shift keying
    on a sinusoidal carrier whose phase is rotated by <font face="times new roman">stem:[π]</font>/2
    for each element of the digital modulating signal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - – Minimum shift keying may be considered as an offset modulation.
