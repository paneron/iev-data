  definition: 'under periodic conditions, mean value, taken over one period stem:[T],
    of the instantaneous power stem:[p]


    stem:[P = (1)/(T) int_0^T p d t]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under sinusoidal conditions, the active power is the real part of the complex
    power stem:[underset(_)(S)], thus stem:[underset(_)(P) = Re underset(_)(S)].
  - The coherent SI unit for active power is watt, W.
