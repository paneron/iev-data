  definition: technique of cooling in which the object to be cooled is immersed in
    a liquid or gaseous coolant and the coolant flows over the object either naturally
    or forced
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Forced convection cooling: technique for cooling by forced flow of a liquid or
    gaseous coolant around the object to be cooled.'
  - 'Natural convection cooling: technique for cooling by a liquid or gaseous coolant
    flow due to the localized heating of the fluid near the surface of the object.'
