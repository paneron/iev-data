  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'A relation stem:[y] = stem:[F(x)] between two quantities stem:[x] and stem:[y],
    where stem:[F] is an operator, is linear if


    stem:[F](stem:[α x]~1~+ stem:[ß x]~2~) = stem:[α F](stem:[x]~1~) + stem:[ß F](stem:[x]~2~)


    where stem:[α] and stem:[ß] are real or complex numbers.'
