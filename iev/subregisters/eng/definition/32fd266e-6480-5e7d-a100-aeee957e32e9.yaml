data:
  definition: a satellite which remains fixed or, by extension, approximately fixed,
    with respect to a system of coordinates associated with the primary body, and
    which therefore appears to be fixed relative to an observer on the surface of
    the primary body
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A stationary satellite is a synchronous satellite with an orbit which is equatorial,
    circular and direct.
