  - 'The adjectives "<a href="IEV845-22-061">bright</a>" and "<a href="IEV845-22-064">light</a>"
    principally have the same meaning, but usually have different applications: lights
    are described as "bright" or "dim", whereas surface colours are described as "light"
    or "dark". However, this distinction is not universal.'
