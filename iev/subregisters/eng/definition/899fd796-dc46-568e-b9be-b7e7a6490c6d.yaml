  definition: 'under sinusoidal conditions in a medium where the phasors stem:[B]
    and stem:[H] representing respectively the magnetic flux density and the magnetic
    field strength are linearly related, complex quantity stem:[μ]~r~ defined by the
    relation


    stem:[B] = stem:[μ]~0~stem:[μ]~r~ stem:[H]


    where stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The complex relative permeability is generally frequency dependent. For an isotropic
    medium the complex relative permeability is a scalar; for an anisotropic medium
    it is a tensor.
  - Generally stem:[μ]~r~ is expressed as stem:[μ]~r~ = stem:[μ]'~r~ − jstem:[μ]''~r~  where
    stem:[μ]'~r~ is the real relative permeability and stem:[μ]''~r~ is the magnetic
    loss index which represents the magnetic losses.
