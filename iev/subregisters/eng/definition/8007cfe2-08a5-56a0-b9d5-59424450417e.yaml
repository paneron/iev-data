data:
  definition: frequency difference, positive or negative, which should be added to
    the specified nominal frequency of the oscillator, when adjusting the oscillator
    frequency under a particular set of operating conditions in order to minimize
    its deviation from the nominal frequency over the specified range of operating
    conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In order to minimize the frequency deviation from the nominal deviation over
    the entire temperature range, a frequency offset may be specified for adjustment
    at the reference temperature (see Figure 18).
