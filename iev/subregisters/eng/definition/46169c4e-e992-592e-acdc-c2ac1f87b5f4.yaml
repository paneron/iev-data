  definition: set of parameters necessary to completely characterize particles and
    fields constituting a given system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a classical system, a microstate may be given by the full set of coordinates
    and momentums of all particles. For a quantum system, a microstate may be described
    by wave functions, density matrices, or state vectors.
