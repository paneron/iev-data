  definition: function for which the argument is an ordered set of stem:[n] numbers
    or scalar quantities
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of the function stem:[f] of stem:[n] variables stem:[x_1 , x_2 , ...
    , x_n] is denoted by stem:[f ( x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n )].
  - In many practical applications in electrotechnology, functions of one variable
    are used. This variable is often the duration and the function is then called
    "function of time" and denoted by stem:[f](stem:[t]). But the variables may also
    be space variables (e.g. coordinates), frequency, etc.
