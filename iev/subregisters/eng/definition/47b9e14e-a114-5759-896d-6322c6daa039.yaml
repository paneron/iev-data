  definition: planarization process for a {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}} by a combination
    of mechanical polishing and chemical etching
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "Chemical mechanical polishing is applied mainly to planarize steps on a substrate\
    \ due to the {{semiconductor, IEV:521-02-01}} manufacturing process. Because the\
    \ steps are composed of a plurality of materials such as substrates, dielectrics\
    \ and metals, various slurries are used to remove selectively each material. In\
    \ \r\n{{micro-electromechanical devices, IEV:523-01-01}}, chemical mechanical\
    \ polishing is used to planarize the bonding surfaces in the {{wafer level packaging,\
    \ IEV:523-06-07}} process."
