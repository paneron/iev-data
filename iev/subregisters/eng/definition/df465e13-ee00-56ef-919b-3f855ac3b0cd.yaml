  definition: 'density of exiting photon flux with respect to area at a point on a
    real or imaginary surface


    stem:[M_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~p~ is photon flux and stem:[A] is the area from which the photon
    flux leaves'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant exitance". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "luminous exitance".
  - The photon exitance is expressed in second to the power minus one per square metre
    (s^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-49 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
