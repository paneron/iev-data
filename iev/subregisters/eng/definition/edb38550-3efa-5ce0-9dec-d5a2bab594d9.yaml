  definition: 'scalar quantity equal to the line integral of a vector quantity along
    a path C from point a to point b in which charge carriers can be displaced:


    stem:[U_i = int_((r_a ( C )))^((r_b)) ( - ((del A))/((del t)) + v xx B ) * d r]


    where *stem:[A]* and *stem:[B]* are respectively a magnetic vector potential and
    the magnetic flux density at a point of the path, stem:[v] is the velocity with
    which that point is moving, *stem:[r]* is position vector, and stem:[t] is time'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The induced voltage is equal to the time derivative of the linked flux corresponding
    to the path, with the positive or negative signs according to the convention in
    IEC 60375.
