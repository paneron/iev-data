  notes:
  - For quantities that have a unit of measurement (i.e. those other than ordinal
    quantities), the numerical value {stem:[Q]} of a quantity stem:[Q] is frequently
    denoted {stem:[Q]} = stem:[Q]/[[stem:[Q]]], where [[stem:[Q]]] denotes the unit.
    For example, for a mass of value expressed as 5,7 kg, the numerical value is {stem:[m]}
    = (5,7 kg)/kg = 5,7. The same value can be expressed as 5 700 g in which case
    the numerical value is {stem:[m]} = (5 700 g)/g = 5 700.
  - For quantities of dimension one, the reference is a unit of measurement which
    is a number and this is not considered as a part of the numerical value. For example,
    in an amount-of-substance fraction equal to 3 mmol/mol, the numerical value is
    3 and the unit is mmol/mol. The unit mmol/mol is numerically equal to 0,001, but
    this number 0,001 is not part of the numerical value, which remains 3.
  - 'Very often quantities of dimension one are expressed in percent. Example: the
    volume fraction of alcohol in a very strong beer is 7,2 %.'
