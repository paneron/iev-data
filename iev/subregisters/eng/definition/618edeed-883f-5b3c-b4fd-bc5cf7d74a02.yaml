  definition: vector *stem:[k]* in the expression stem:[omega t - k * r + vartheta_0]
    of the phase of a sinusoidal wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The wave vector is normal to the wave front and its magnitude is the angular wavenumber.
  - This concept can be generalized to complex wave vector in order to take attenuation
    in account (see IEC 60050-705).
