data:
  definition: radionavigation system based on the measurement of delay differences
    for radio signals transmitted by several pairs of associated transmitters; for
    each pair of transmitters, isochronous curves appear as nearly hyperbolic and
    the location of a mobile station can be determined from the families of curves
    associated with two or more pairs of transmitters
