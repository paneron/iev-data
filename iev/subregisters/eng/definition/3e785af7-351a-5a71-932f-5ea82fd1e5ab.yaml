  definition: 'shape of the curve assumed by a perfectly flexible, inextensible cord
    suspended at its ends, and given by the equation:


    stem:[Y = rho ( cosh (X)/(rho) - 1 )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In practice, the simple parabola is often used


    stem:[Y = (1)/((2 rho)) X^2]


    which represents the first two terms of the series expansion of the equation of
    the catenary.'
  - The catenary curve represents a cable with constant weight per unit of length
    of curve, while the parabola represents a wire with a constant weight per horizontal
    unit of length. The sag calculated by the parabolic equation is smaller than that
    calculated by the catenary equation. For long spans or for very sloping spans
    the parabolic approximation can introduce unacceptable errors.
