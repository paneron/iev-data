data:
  definition: fractional change in output frequency resulting from an incremental
    change in supply voltage, other parameters remaining unchanged
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of oven controlled crystal oscillators (OCXOs), a considerable time
    may elapse before the full effect of a supply voltage change is observed, as the
    temperature of the oven may drift gradually to a new value following the voltage
    perturbation.
