  definition: array of stem:[mn] scalars arranged in stem:[m] rows and stem:[n] columns
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The scalars in the array are called elements of the matrix.
  - The matrix notation is also used with scalar quantities instead of scalars, these
    quantities being not necessarily of the same kind. Examples are the impedance
    matrix and the stem:[H]-matrix (see IEC 60027-2). A matrix notation is sometimes
    used for operators. This should be justified in each case.
  - 'A matrix is represented by a letter symbol in italic bold-face type or by the
    table of elements within parentheses: *stem:[A]* or stem:[( [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1
    n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((m 1)),cdots,A_((m n))]] )]. The notation (stem:[Aij])
    is also used, for example to distinguish the matrix *stem:[A]* from a vector *stem:[A]*.
    Square brackets are also used instead of parentheses. For a matrix *stem:[A]*,
    the element at the row stem:[i] and the column stem:[j] may be denoted by (*stem:[A]*)~ij~
    or by stem:[Aij] if there is no ambiguity.'
  - A matrix is complex if its elements are complex numbers or quantities. A complex
    matrix may be denoted by *stem:[A]*, the elements by (*stem:[A]*)~stem:[ij]~ or
    (*stem:[A]*)~stem:[ij]~.
