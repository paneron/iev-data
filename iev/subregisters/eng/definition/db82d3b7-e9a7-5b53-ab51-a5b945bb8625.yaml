  notes:
  - Dose equivalent limits may be set for occupational or non-occupational exposure
    and different values may be specified for different groups within a population.
  - In applying dose equivalent limits, absorbed doses received from medical exposures
    or from normal exposure to natural radiation may be disregarded.
