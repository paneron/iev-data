  definition: the loss, expressed in decibels, which has to be introduced into a working
    standard in order to obtain in a given direction the same loudness as the telephone
    call being considered, the acoustical speech power emitted by the talker being
    the same in both cases
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The relative equivalent is positive or negative according to whether it has been
    necessary for a loss to be added or removed from that standard.
  - The reference equivalent is approximately equal to the sum of the relative equivalent
    measured with respect to a working standard and of the reference equivalent of
    this working standard.
  - The relative equivalent is strictly defined by the measuring method described
    in the CCITT Recommendation P72 from the Volume V of the Red Book, 1985.
