  definition: '{{signal, IEV:171-01-03}} in which the characteristic carrying information
    can assume any value within a continuous interval of values'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A continuous value signal can be a {{continuous-time signal, IEV:171-01-10}},
    and therefore an {{analogue signal, IEV:171-01-14}}, or a {{discretely timed signal,
    IEV:171-01-12}}.
