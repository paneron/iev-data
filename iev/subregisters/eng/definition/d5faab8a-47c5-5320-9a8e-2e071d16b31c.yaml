  definition: 'for a resistive two-terminal element or two-terminal circuit with terminals
    A and B, derivative of the voltage stem:[u]~AB~ &amp;lsqb;{{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}&amp;rsqb;
    between the terminals with respect to the electric current stem:[i] in the element
    or circuit:


    stem:[R_d = ((d u_((AB))))/((d i))]


    where the electric current is taken as positive if its direction is from A to
    B and negative in the opposite case'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an ideal resistor, the differential resistance stem:[R]~d~ is equal to its
    resistance stem:[R].
