  concept: bc2c9518-14a4-5ec8-b8fe-1ba327b751e9
  definition: qualifies a boundary which does not allow heat to pass through, or a
    process which runs in a system without exchange of heat between the system and
    its surrounding
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 A adiabatic wall has the opposite property as an diathermic wall.
  - 2 An approximation of an adiabatic enclosure is e.g. a thermos flask. An approximation
    of an adiabatic process is a process occurring inside a thermo flask or a process
    passing so quickly that the exchange of heat with its surrounding is negligible.
