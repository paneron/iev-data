  definition: an electromagnetic wave which is both a homogeneous plane wave and a
    travelling wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of a sinusoidal travelling plane wave, in a homogeneous medium in
    the direction of propagation and for each component of the wave, the phase varies
    linearly with the distance and the amplitude is constant or, if the medium is
    dissipative, decreases exponentially with distance.
