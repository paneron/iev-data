  definition: permitted band occupied by the valence electrons
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The valence band in an ideal crystal is completely occupied at the temperature
    of zero kelvin.
  - Electrons missing from the valence band give rise to conduction holes in the valence
    band and conduction electrons in the conduction band.
