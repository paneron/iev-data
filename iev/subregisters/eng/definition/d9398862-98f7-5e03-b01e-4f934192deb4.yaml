  definition: 'for a linear time-invariant system with a sinusoidal input variable
    in steady state of the output variable the ratio of the amplitude of the output
    variable to the amplitude of the corresponding input variable at a given angular
    frequency


    SEE: Figure 10.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The gain is the modulus (absolute value) of the frequency response at a given
    angular frequency.
  - In practical use the gain at angular frequencies other than zero is often called
    "dynamic gain" as opposed to the "static gain" at angular frequency zero.
  - A common definition of “gain” in the meaning “amplification, benefit” has been
    given in IEC 60050-702:1992, 702-02-11.
  - This entry was numbered 351-24-34 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
