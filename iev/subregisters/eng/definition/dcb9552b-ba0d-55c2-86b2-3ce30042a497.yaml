  definition: "pertains to a configuration of points in the Euclidean three-dimensional\
    \ space when the configuration is unchanged by a given mapping of the space into\
    \ itself which preserves Euclidean distances\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\n\n* symmetric by\
    \ translation for a periodic configuration, \n\n* symmetric by rotation of 2Ï€/stem:[n],\
    \ where stem:[n] is an integer, or by any rotation, \n\n* symmetric by mirroring,\
    \ \n\n* and combinations thereof."
