  notes:
  - 'These levels may be two logic levels stem:[V]~OL~ and stem:[V]~OH~ or 10 % to
    90 % of its maximum amplitude (stem:[V]~HI~ – stem:[V]~LO~), or any other ratio
    defined in the detail specification


    where


    stem:[V]~OL~  is the low level output voltage


    stem:[V]~OH~  is the high level output voltage


    stem:[V]~HI~  is the upper flat voltage of the pulse waveform


    stem:[V]~LO~  is the low flat voltage of the pulse waveform.'
