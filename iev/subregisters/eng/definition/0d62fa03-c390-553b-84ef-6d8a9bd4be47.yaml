  definition: SI unit of luminous flux
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 lm is equal to the luminous flux of a beam of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic
    radiation</a> whose {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} is 540 × 10^12^ Hz and whose
    radiant flux is 1/683 W.
  - According to the 9^th^ General Conference of Weights and Measures (1948), the
    lumen is defined as the luminous flux emitted in unit solid angle (steradian)
    by a <a href="IEV845-21-098">uniform point source</a> having a luminous intensity
    of 1 cd.
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-51 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
