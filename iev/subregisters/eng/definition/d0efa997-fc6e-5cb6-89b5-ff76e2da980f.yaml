  definition: change in <a href="IEV845-22-067">hue</a> produced by changing the luminance
    (within the range of photopic vision) of a colour stimulus while keeping its chromaticity
    constant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - With certain monochromatic stimuli, hue remains constant over a wide range of
    luminances (for a given condition of adaptation). The wavelengths of these stimuli
    are sometimes referred to as "invariant wavelengths".
  - With increasing intensity, below 510 nm hues shift more towards blue, and above
    510 nm hues shift more towards yellow (reds become yellower with increasing brightness).
  - This entry was numbered 845-02-39 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
