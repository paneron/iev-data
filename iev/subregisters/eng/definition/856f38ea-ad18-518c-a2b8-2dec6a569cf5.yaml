  definition: 'relative decrease in radiant flux caused by scattering expressed by
    the relative density of the spectral radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~e,~stem:[λ](stem:[λ]),
    with respect to propagation length, stem:[l], of a collimated beam at a point
    in a diffusing medium


    stem:[s ( lambda ) = (1)/((Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ))) ((d Phi_((e , lambda))
    ( lambda )))/((d l))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The spectral linear scattering coefficient is expressed in metre to the power
    minus one (m^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-77 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
