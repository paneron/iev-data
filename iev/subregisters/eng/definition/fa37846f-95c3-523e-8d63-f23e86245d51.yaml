  definition: the ratio of two complex quantities characterizing a signal as a function
    of frequency at the output and corresponding input of a device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The transfer function may be taken as the ratio of the Fourier or Laplace transforms
    of the output and input quantities expressed as functions of time. The term frequency
    response essentially denotes a ratio of the Fourier transforms.
  - The transfer function is the Laplace or Fourier transform of the impulse response.
