  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing a transfer of heat, defined by
    stem:[N u = ((K l))/(lambda)], where stem:[K] is coefficient of heat transfer,
    stem:[l] is a length characterizing the configuration, and stem:[λ] is thermal
    conductivity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The Nusselt number is often calculated by empiric formulas as a function of
    other characteristic numbers (Reynolds number stem:[Re], Prandtl number stem:[Pr],
    Péclet number stem:[Pe], Grashof number stem:[Gr]), and then used to determine
    the coefficient of heat transfer stem:[K].
  - 2 The name “Biot number”, symbol stem:[Bi], is used when the Nusselt number is
    reserved for convective transport of heat.
