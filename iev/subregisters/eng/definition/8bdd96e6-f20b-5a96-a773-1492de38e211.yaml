  definition: two-terminal-pair network for which the sum of instantaneous powers
    at the two-terminal pairs is identically equal to zero and for which the ratio
    of the input voltage to the output electric current has a constant value stem:[R]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For an ideal gyrator, the input voltage stem:[u]~1~, the output voltage stem:[u]~2~,
    the input current stem:[i]~1~ and the output current stem:[i]~2~ are related by
    the formula:


    stem:[((u_1))/((i_2)) = - ((u_2))/((i_1)) = R]


    with the usual reference conventions for associated voltages and currents given
    for two-port networks in IEC 60375:2003, Clause 7.'
  - 'Under sinusoidal conditions, the impedance stem:[Z]~1~ seen at the input port
    is the product of the terminating admittance stem:[Y] at the output port by the
    square of the constant stem:[R]:


    stem:[Z]~1~ = stem:[R]^2^stem:[Y]'
  - An ideal gyrator is a circuit element that neither stores nor dissipates energy.
    The gyrator as a device is defined in IEC 60050-726.
