  definition: 'quotient of the natural (Napierian) logarithm of the reciprocal of
    the spectral internal transmittance, stem:[τ]~i~(stem:[λ]), of a layer of the
    medium and the length, stem:[l], of the path of a beam of radiation traversing
    that layer


    stem:[a_n ( lambda ) = - ((ln tau_i ( lambda )))/(l) = ((log tau_i ( lambda )))/(l)
    ln(10) = ((A_n ( lambda )))/(l)]


    where stem:[A]~n~(stem:[λ]) is Napierian spectral absorbance.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Napierian spectral absorption coefficient is expressed in metre to the power
    minus one (m^−1^).
