  definition: characteristic whereby the thermal output of a resistance-heating device
    at its rated voltage decreases as the temperature of its surroundings increases
    until the device reaches a temperature at which its thermal output is reduced
    to a value at which there is no further rise in temperature
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The temperature of the surface of the element is then effectively that of its
    surroundings.
