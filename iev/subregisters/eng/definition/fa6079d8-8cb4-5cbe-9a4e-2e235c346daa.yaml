  definition: digital encoding of a colour space, including the specification of a
    digital encoding method, and an encoding range
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Multiple colour space encodings can be defined based on a single colour space
    where the different colour space encodings have different digital encoding methods
    and/or encoding ranges. (For example, 8-bit sRGB in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1,
    _Multimedia systems and equipment – Colour measurement and management – Part 2-1:
    Colour management – Default RGB colour space – sRGB_ and 16-bit scRGB in accordance
    with IEC 61966-2-2, _Multimedia systems and equipment – Colour measurement and
    management – Part 2-2: Colour management – Extended RGB colour space – scRGB_
    are different colour space encodings based on a particular RGB colour space.)'
  - A colour space encoding is defined with a number of colour channels, each channel
    corresponding to one dimension of the colour space. Encoded colour channel data
    values indicate a position along the corresponding dimension in the geometric
    colour space representation.
