  definition: 'quantity stem:[R]~eq~, having the dimensions of resistance, used to
    express the equivalent noise voltage stem:[E]~n~ of a one port device through
    the relationship:


    stem:[R_((eq)) = ((E_n^2))/((4 k T_0 Delta f))]


    where stem:[T]~0~ is a reference thermodynamic temperature, fixed by convention
    around 290 K, Î”stem:[f] is the bandwidth considered and stem:[k] is Boltzmann''s
    constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A receiving antenna can be regarded as a one-port device when viewed from its
    output port.
