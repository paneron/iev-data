  definition: single sequence of operations made by a user of a {{telecommunication
    network, IEV:701-02-07}} trying to obtain the desired user, {{terminal, IEV:715-01-06}}
    or service
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Such a sequence is sufficient in favourable cases; it cannot suffice in situations
    such as {{blocking, IEV:715-02-15}}, {{faults, IEV:192-04-01}}, etc.
  - At a given point of the network a call attempt is manifested by a single unsuccessful
    {{bid, IEV:715-02-03}}, or a successful bid and all the subsequent identifiable
    activity related to the establishment of a {{connection, IEV:701-03-01}}.
