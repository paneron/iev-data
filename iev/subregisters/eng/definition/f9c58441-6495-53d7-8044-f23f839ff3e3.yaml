  definition: 'value showing the sharpness of the resonance, commonly used to represent
    the merit of the resonator, defined as


    stem:[Q_S = ((omega_r L_1))/((R_1))]


    where


    stem:[omega_r = 2 pi f_r] is the angular resonance frequency;


    stem:[f]~r~  is the resonance frequency;


    stem:[L]~1~ is the motional inductance;


    stem:[R]~1~ is the motional resistance'
