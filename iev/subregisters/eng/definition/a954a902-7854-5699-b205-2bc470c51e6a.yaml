data:
  definition: set of operations which is used to check whether the indications, under
    specified conditions, correspond with a given set of known measurands within the
    limits of a predetermined calibration diagram
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This term is used in the "uncertainty" approach.
  - The known uncertainty of the measurand used for verification will generally be
    negligible with respect to the uncertainty assigned to the instrument in the calibration
    diagram.
