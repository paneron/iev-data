  definition: phenomenon in which a superconducting state appears within about one
    coherence length from the surface of a material even under a magnetic field strength
    above the upper critical field strength, stem:[H]~c2~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the magnetic field is parallel to the surface of the sample, surface superconductivity
    appears within a range of a magnetic field strength from stem:[H]~c2~ to stem:[H]~cstem:[3]~
    = 1,695 stem:[H]~c2~ for type II superconductors and from stem:[H]~c~ to stem:[H]~c3~
    = 2,40 stem:[H]~c~ for type I superconductors.
