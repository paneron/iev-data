  definition: 'quantity stem:[Q] which can be represented by a tensor of the second
    order stem:[T] multiplied by a scalar quantity stem:[q]


    stem:[Q = q T]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'A tensor quantity often describes a linear transformation of a vector quantity
    *stem:[U]* into a vector quantity *stem:[V]*:


    stem:[V_i = underset(j)( sum ) Q_((i j)) U_j]'
  - The expression of a tensor quantity in terms of its components is similar to the
    expression of vector quantities (see Note 1 to entry in {{IEV 102-03-22, IEV:102-03-22}}).
    Examples of tensor quantities are the permittivity and the permeability in anisotropic
    media, see IEC 60050-121.
  - Operations defined for tensors apply to tensor quantities.
