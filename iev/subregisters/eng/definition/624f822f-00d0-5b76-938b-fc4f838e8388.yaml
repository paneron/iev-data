data:
  definition: ratio of the number of dissociation events to the maximum number of
    theoretically possible dissociation events
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Dissociation may occur stepwise, as in the following example:


    H~3~PO~4~ → H^+^+ H~2~(PO~4~)^−^


    H~3~PO~4~ → 2H^+^+ H(PO~4~)^−2^


    H~3~PO~4~ → 3H^+^+ (PO~4~)^−3^


    Dissociation degrees are 1/3, 2/3, and 1 for the three reactions above, respectively.'
