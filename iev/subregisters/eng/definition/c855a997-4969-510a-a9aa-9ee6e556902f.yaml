  definition: axial vector quantity describing the rotation around an axis, with magnitude
    stem:[omega = | d phi // d t |], where stem:[d phi] is the plane angle change
    during the infinitesimal time interval with duration dstem:[t], and with direction
    along the axis for which the rotation is clockwise
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 In an inertial frame, the angular velocity does not depend on the chosen coordinate
    system provided that the orientation of space is kept (either right-handed or
    left-handed).
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of angular velocity is radian per second, rad/s.
