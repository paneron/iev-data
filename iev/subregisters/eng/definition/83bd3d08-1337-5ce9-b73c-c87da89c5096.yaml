  notes:
  - 'Four generic product categories are noted in ISO 9000:2000: services (e.g. transport);
    software (e.g. computer program, dictionary); hardware (e.g. engine, mechanical
    part); processed materials (e.g. lubricant). Many products comprise elements belonging
    to different generic product categories. Whether the product is then called service,
    software, hardware or processed material depends on the dominant element.'
  - The statement of conformity described in Note 1 to {{902-04-02, IEV:902-04-02}}
    can be regarded as a product of {{attestation, IEV:902-04-02}}.
