data:
  definition: a flow control such that the rate at which data are transmitted from
    one data terminal equipment is not more than the rate at which they can be received
    by the remote terminal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This procedure may apply between a data terminal equipment and the adjacent data
    switching exchange or between two data terminals. In the latter case the transfer
    rate may be controlled due to network or remote data terminal equipment requirements.
  - This procedure may operate independently in the two directions of data transfer
    thus permitting different data transfer rates in these directions.
