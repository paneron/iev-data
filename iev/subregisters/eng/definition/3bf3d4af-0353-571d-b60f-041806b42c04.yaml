  definition: 'the energy imparted by ionizing radiation to the matter in a volume


    stem:[epsilon = sum epsilon_((in)) - sum epsilon_((ex)) + sum Q]


    where Σstem:[ε]~in~ is the sum of the energies (excluding rest energies) of all
    directly and indirectly ionizing particles incident on the volume, Σstem:[ε]~ex~
    is the sum of the energies (excluding rest energies) of all directly and indirectly
    ionizing particles emerging from the volume, and Σstem:[Q] is the sum of all changes
    (decreases: positive sign; increases: negative sign) of rest energy of nuclei
    and elementary particles in any transformations which occur in the volume'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[ε] is a stochastic quantity.
