  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[Е]~tr~ by dstem:[m], where dstem:[Е]~tr~ is
    the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated
    by indirectly ionizing particles in a material of mass dstem:[m]

  - 'The SI unit of kerma is the joule per kilogram and is given the special name
    gray (Gy). The earlier special unit of kerma, still in temporary use, was the
    rad.


    1 Gy = 100 rad = 1 J kg^−1^'
