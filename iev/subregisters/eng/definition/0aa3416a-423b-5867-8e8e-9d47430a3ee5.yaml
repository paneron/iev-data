  definition: mechanical {{device, IEV:151-11-20}} that grasps microscopic objects
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Microgrippers have two roles. They can be used as tools to assemble {{micromachines,
    IEV:523-01-03}} or as the hands of microrobots, etc. In either case, the microgripper
    has fingers to grasp objects and an {{actuator, IEV:151-13-49}} to handle them.
    Compared to a microrobot hand, microgrippers are structurally large but require
    precise control. As the function of a microgripper is simply to grasp an object,
    multi-degrees of freedom handling requires the combination of suitable manipulators.
    Compared to non-contact-type handling using a laser beam, contact-type handling
    based on a microgripper or similar device gives better attitude control of the
    object. However, if the object to be handled is below several tens of micrometres
    in size, the attractive forces between the surfaces of the microgripper fingers
    and the object handled make manipulation difficult.
