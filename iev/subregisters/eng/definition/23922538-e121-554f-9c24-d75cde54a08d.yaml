  definition: 'law giving the force between two charged particles, expressed by the
    relation


    stem:[F_((12)) = k * ((Q_1 Q_2))/((r^2)) * ((r_((21))))/(r) = k * ((Q_1 Q_2))/((r^2))
    * e_((21))]


    where stem:[*F*]~12~ is the force exerted on the particle with electric charge
    stem:[Q]~1~ by the particle with electric charge stem:[Q]~2~ , stem:[k] a positive
    constant, stem:[*r*]~21~ the vector from the particle with electric charge stem:[Q]~2~
    to the particle with electric charge stem:[Q]~1~, stem:[r] = |stem:[*r*]~21~|
    the distance between particles and stem:[*e*]~21~ the unit vector stem:[*r*]~21~/stem:[r]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In vacuum the constant stem:[k] is equal to 1/4πstem:[ε]~0~ where stem:[ε]~0~
    is the electric constant.
