  definition: quotient of the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}} and the
    speed of light in a medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of the refractive index can depend on the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}},
    polarization, and direction.
  - The refractive index is expressed by stem:[n] = stem:[c]~0~/stem:[c,] where stem:[c]~0~
    is the speed of light in vacuum and stem:[c] is the speed of light in the medium.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-24-111">complex refractive index</a>.
  - The refractivity is expressed by stem:[n] − 1, where stem:[n] is refractive index.
  - The refractive index has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-101 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
