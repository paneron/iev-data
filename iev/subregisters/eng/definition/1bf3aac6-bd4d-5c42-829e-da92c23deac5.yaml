  definition: 'completely determined finite sequence of instructions by which the
    values of the output variables may be calculated from the values of the input
    variables


    Note 1 to entry:  The behaviour of a system with discrete-value input and output
    variables (for example a switching system) may be described completely by an algorithm.
    For a system with continuous-value and continuous-time input and output variables
    the algorithm is given by or derived from the mathematical relationship between
    the input and output variables.
