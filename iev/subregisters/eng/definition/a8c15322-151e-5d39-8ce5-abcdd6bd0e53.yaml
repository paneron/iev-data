  definition: 'the current in a device when further increase in voltage produces practically
    no increase in current.


    Examples:


    1) In an ionization chamber: the electric current which results when the applied
    potential is sufficient to collect practically all ions.


    2) In an X-ray tube: the electric current in the tube when practically all emitted
    electrons reach the anode.'
