  definition: of a substance, for a parallel beam of radiation, the quantity stem:[μ]~abs~
    in the expression stem:[μ]~abs~dstem:[х] for the fraction of energy absorbed in
    passing through a thin layer of thickness dstem:[х] of that substance. It is a
    function of the energy of the radiation. According as to whether dstem:[х] is
    expressed in terms of length, mass per unit area, moles per unit area, or atoms
    per unit area stem:[μ]~abs~ is called the linear, mass, molar, or atomic absorption
    coefficient
