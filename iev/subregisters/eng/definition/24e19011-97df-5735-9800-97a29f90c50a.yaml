  definition: 'control structure with several control levels placed one over the other,
    in which the control equipment assigned to a higher level coordinates the work
    of the control equipment assigned to the next lower level, providing for instance
    pre-determining control tasks, command variables, reference variables or final
    controlled variables


    SEE: Figures 24 and 25.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Depending upon application, different control level models are used (see Figure
    28). Nowadays standardization is not possible. The control level models shown
    in Figure 28 should serve as examples for possible hierarchical structures.
