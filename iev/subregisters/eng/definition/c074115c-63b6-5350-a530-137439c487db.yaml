  definition: surface resistance reduced to a square
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For insulating materials the surface resistivity is usually determined by means
    of measuring electrodes arranged on a sheet of the material.
  - The surface resistivity includes the effect of possible polarization phenomena
    at the electrodes.
  - The numerical value of the surface resistivity is independent of the size of the
    area.
