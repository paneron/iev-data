  definition: mean value of illuminance on the outer curved surface of a very small
    (real or imaginary) sphere at a point in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The spherical illuminance can be expressed by


    stem:[E_((v,o)) = underset((4 pi))( int ) L_v d omega]


    where stem:[Ω] is solid angle and stem:[L]~v~ is luminance.'
  - The spherical illuminance is the quotient of the luminous flux of all the light
    incident on the outer surface of an infinitely small sphere centred at the given
    point and the area of the diametrical cross-section of that sphere.
  - The analogous quantities "<a href="IEV845-21-054">spherical irradiance</a>", stem:[E]~e,o~,
    and "<a href="IEV845-21-059">photon spherical irradiance</a>" (also termed "photon
    fluence rate"), stem:[E]~p,o~, are defined in a similar way, replacing <a href="IEV845-21-050">luminance</a>,
    stem:[L]~v~, by <a href="IEV845-21-049">radiance</a>, stem:[L]~e~, and photon
    radiance, stem:[L]~p~, respectively.
  - The spherical illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
