  definition: a photodiode operating with a bias voltage such that the primary photocurrent
    undergoes amplification by cumulative multiplication of charge carriers
  examples: []
  notes:
  - As the reverse-bias voltage approaches the breakdown voltage, hole-electron pairs
    created by absorbed photons acquire sufficient energy to create additional hole-electron
    pairs when they collide with ions.
