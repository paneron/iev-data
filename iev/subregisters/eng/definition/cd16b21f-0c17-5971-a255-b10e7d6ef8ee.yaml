  definition: 'a) of an electroacoustic transducer for sound emission, at a specified
    frequency, ratio of the square of the free-field sound pressure at a fixed point
    on the principal axis, to the mean-square sound pressure over the surface of a
    sphere concentric with the effective acoustic centre of the transducer, and passing
    through the fixed point


    b) of an electroacoustic transducer for sound reception, at a specified frequency,
    ratio of the square of the free-field sensitivity to sound waves that arrive along
    the principal axis, to the mean-square sensitivity to a succession of sound waves
    that arrive at the transducer with equal probability from all directions'
