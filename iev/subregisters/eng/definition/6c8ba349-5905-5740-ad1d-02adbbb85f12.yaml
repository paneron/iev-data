data:
  definition: technique used for concealing light source(s) and surfaces of high luminance
    from direct view in order to reduce glare, or to reduce light emission above the
    horizontal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In outdoor lighting, cut-off classifications define the luminous intensity limits
    in two illumination zones that occur within the range of 80째 to 180째 above nadir.
    Light emitted in the 80째 to 90째 zone is more likely to contribute to glare, and
    light emitted above the horizontal is more likely to contribute to sky glow.
  - In public lighting, distinction is made between full-cut-off luminaires, semi-cut-off
    luminaires and non-cut-off luminaires.
