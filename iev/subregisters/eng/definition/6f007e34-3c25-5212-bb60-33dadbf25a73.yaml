data:
  definition: in crystalline substances lacking a centre of symmetry, phenomenon in
    which electric polarization produces a mechanical deformation which depends linearly
    on the electric field strength, and conversely a deformation produces an electric
    polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Electrostriction can occur in addition to the piezoelectric effect.
