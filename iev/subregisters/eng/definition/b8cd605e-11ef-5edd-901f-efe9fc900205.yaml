  definition: in a radio receiver or repeater, the frequency corresponding to the
    carrier frequency or another characteristic frequency of an input radio-frequency
    signal in a signal resulting from each frequency translation

  notes:
  - A receiver may use more than one frequency translation and so have several intermediate
    frequencies.
  - This expression or the abbreviation “IF” is used to identify the frequency band
    translated from the radio-frequency band or a device operating in this band.
