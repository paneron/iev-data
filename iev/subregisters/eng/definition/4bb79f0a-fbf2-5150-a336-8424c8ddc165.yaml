data:
  definition: that region of the electromagnetic field of an antenna wherein the predominant
    components of the field are those which represent a propagation of energy and
    wherein the angular field distribution is essentially independent of the distance
    from the antenna
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the far field region, all the components of the electromagnetic field decrease
    in inverse proportion to the distance from the antenna.
  - For a broadside antenna having a maximum overall dimension stem:[D] which is large
    compared to the wavelength stem:[λ], the far field region is commonly taken to
    exist at distances greater than 2stem:[D]^2^/stem:[λ], from the antenna in the
    direction of maximum radiation.
