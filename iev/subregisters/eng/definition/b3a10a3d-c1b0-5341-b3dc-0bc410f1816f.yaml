data:
  definition: reciprocal of the least perceptible luminance contrast, usually expressed
    as stem:[L]/Δstem:[L]~th~, where stem:[L] is the average luminance and Δstem:[L]~th~
    is the luminance difference threshold
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The value of stem:[S]~c~ depends on a number of factors including the luminance,
    the viewing conditions and the state of adaptation.
  - The contrast sensitivity has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-02-48 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
