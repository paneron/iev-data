  definition: hormone secreted from the pineal gland
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Levels of melatonin in the pineal gland, blood, saliva, and urine fluctuate in
    a circadian rhythm, higher at night and lower in the daytime, following the biological
    clock that is itself set naturally by day/night photoperiods. Light at night reduces
    melatonin, while decoupling the biological and natural (or artificially induced)
    photoperiods causes disruption of sleep/wake cycles (e.g. jet lag).
