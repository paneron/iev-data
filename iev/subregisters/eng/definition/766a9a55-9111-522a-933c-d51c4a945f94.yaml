  definition: 'axial vector stem:[U xx V], orthogonal to two given vectors *stem:[U]*
    and *stem:[V]*, such that the three vectors *stem:[U]*, *stem:[V]* and stem:[U
    xx V] form a right-handed trihedron or a left-handed trihedron according to the
    space orientation, with its magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of
    the given vectors and the sine of the angle stem:[vartheta] between them


    stem:[| U xx V | = | U | * | V | * sin vartheta]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the three-dimensional Euclidean space with given space orientation, the vector
    product of two vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* is the unique axial vector stem:[U
    xx V] such that for any vector *stem:[W]* in the same vector space the scalar
    triple product (*stem:[U]*,*stem:[V]*,*stem:[W]*) is equal to the scalar product
    stem:[( U xx V ) * W].
  - 'For two vectors stem:[U = U_x e_x + U_y e_y + U_z e_z] and stem:[V = V_x e_x
    + V_y e_y + V_z e_z], where stem:[e_x , e_y , e_z] is an orthonormal base, the
    vector product is expressed by stem:[U xx V = ( U_y V_z - U_z V_y ) e_x + ( U_z
    V_x - U_x V_z ) e_y + ( U_x V_y - U_y V_x ) e_z].


    The vector product can also be expressed as stem:[U xx V = | [[e_x,e_y,e_z],[U_x,U_y,U_z],[V_x,V_y,V_z]]
    |] using a sum similar to the sum used to obtain the determinant of a matrix.
    The vector product is therefore the axial vector associated with the antisymmetric
    tensor stem:[U ox V - V ox U] (see {{IEV 102-03-43, IEV:102-03-43}}).'
  - For two complex vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]*, either the vector product stem:[U
    xx V] or one of the vector products stem:[U^( * ) xx V] or stem:[U xx V^( * )]
    may be used depending on the application.
  - A vector product can be similarly defined for a pair consisting of a polar vector
    and an axial vector and is then a polar vector, or for a pair of two axial vectors
    and is then an axial vector.
  - In the usual three-dimensional space, the vector product of two vector quantities
    is the vector product of the associated unit vectors multiplied by the product
    of the scalar quantities.
  - The vector product operation is denoted by a cross (×) between the two symbols
    representing the vectors. The use of the symbol ∧ is deprecated.
