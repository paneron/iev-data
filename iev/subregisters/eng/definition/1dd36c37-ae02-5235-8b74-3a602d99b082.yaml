    of standard frequencies and time signals. It corresponds exactly in rate with
    international atomic time, but differs from it by an integral number of seconds
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Coordinated universal time is established by the International Bureau of Weights
    and Measures (BIPM) and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS).
  - The UTC scale is adjusted by the insertion or deletion of seconds, so called positive
    or negative leap seconds, to ensure approximate agreement with UT1.
