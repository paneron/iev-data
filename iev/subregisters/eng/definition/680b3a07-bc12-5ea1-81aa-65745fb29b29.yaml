  definition: quantity obtained by subtracting from an alternating quantity its fundamental
    component or its reference fundamental component
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The total distortion content includes harmonic components and interharmonic components
    if any.
  - The total distortion content depends on the choice of the fundamental component.
    If it is not clear from the context which one is subtracted an indication should
    be given.
  - The total distortion content is a time function.
  - An alternating quantity is a periodic quantity with zero DC component.
