data:
  definition: the highest frequency by which a radio wave can propagate between given
    terminals below the ionosphere, on a specified occasion, by ionospheric refraction
    alone
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Where the basic MUF is restricted to a particular ionospheric mode of propagation,
    the values may be quoted together with an indication of that mode, for example
    2F2 MUF.
  - If the extraordinary wave is involved, then this is noted, for example, 1F2 MUF(x).
    Absence of a specific reference to the magneto-ionic component implies that the
    quoted value relates to the ordinary wave.
  - If it is desired to quote the ground range for which the basic MUF applies, this
    is indicated in kilometres following the indication of the mode type, for example
    1F2 (4000) MUF.
