  definition: form of modulation in which the average power spectral density of the
    transmitted signal is spread in a random or quasi-random way over a bandwidth
    which is much wider than the bandwidth that is strictly necessary for the information
    to be transmitted
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Spread spectrum modulation permits multiple access to a communication path and
    increases immunity to radio-frequency noise and interference.
