  definition: the phase difference, as a function of frequency, between the fundamental
    component of the output signal of a two-port device and the corresponding sinusoidal
    input signal of specified amplitude
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of a linear time-invariant two-port device the phase/ frequency characteristic
    is represented by the argument of the frequency response.
