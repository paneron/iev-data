  definition: 'change in radiant energy with time


    stem:[Phi_e = ((d Q_e))/((d t))]


    where stem:[Q]~e~ is the radiant energy emitted, transferred or received, and
    stem:[t] is time'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous flux". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon flux".
  - The term "radiant flux" is the preferred term for most radiometric applications,
    with the notable exception of laser radiometry where the term "radiant power"
    is more commonly used.
  - The radiant flux is expressed in watt (W).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-24 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
