  definition: quotient of the reflected radiance at a point on a surface of a non-self-radiating
    medium in a given direction and that of the perfect reflecting diffuser identically
    irradiated and viewed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In general, the reflected radiance factor from a surface does not depend upon
    the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> of the irradiation.
    This is not the case for a photoluminescent surface, where it is necessary to
    specify this quantity.
  - The reflected radiance factor has unit one.
