  definition: for an electroacoustic transducer used for sound emission, in a specified
    direction, for a specified frequency and range of distances, position of the virtual
    point source from which sound pressure varies inversely as distance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The effective acoustic centre of a reciprocal transducer when used for sound reception
    is coincident with the acoustic centre when used for sound emission.
