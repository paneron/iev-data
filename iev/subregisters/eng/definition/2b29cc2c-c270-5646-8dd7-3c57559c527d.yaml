  definition: type of control for which the performance index reaches a largest or
    smallest value under specified conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Performance index is a mathematical expression which characterises the quality
    of control under given conditions.
  - 'The determination of optimal control parameters frequently results from minimising
    integral criteria which are often called control areas from the geometric interpretation
    of the integral. The most important ones are:


    stem:[I_((IAE)) = int_0^(oo) | e ( t ) | * d t] Criterion of Integral Absolute
    Error


    stem:[I_((ISE)) = int_0^(oo) e^2 ( t ) * d t] Criterion of Integral Squared Error


    stem:[I_((ITAE)) = int_0^(oo) t * | e ( t ) | * d t] Criterion of Integral of
    Time multiplied Absolute value of Error


    Therein stem:[e](stem:[t]) is the control difference variable as a function of
    time as answer to an input appropriate to the technological task, for example
    a response to a stepwise change of the reference variable.'
