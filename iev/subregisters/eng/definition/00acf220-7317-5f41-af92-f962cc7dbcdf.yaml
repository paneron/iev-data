  definition: atomic and molecular level surface processing (atomic manipulation)
    using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - STM machining, an example of which uses atoms to write characters, is well known
    and can be used to perform processing at the molecular and atomic levels. This
    technology is extremely sensitive to vibration, which makes its application difficult.
