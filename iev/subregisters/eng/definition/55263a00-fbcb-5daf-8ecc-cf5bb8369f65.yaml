  definition: pseudo-scalar, denoted by (*stem:[U]*,*stem:[V]*,*stem:[W]*), assigned
    to an ordered set of three vectors *stem:[U]*, *stem:[V]*, *stem:[W]* in the three-dimensional
    Euclidean space, equal to the scalar product stem:[U * ( V xx W )]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The scalar triple product of three vectors *stem:[U]*, *stem:[V]*, *stem:[W]*
    is the determinant of the vectors relative to a given orthonormal base:


    stem:[( U , â€‹ V , W ) = | [[U_1,U_2,U_3],[V_1,V_2,V_3],[W_1,W_2,W_3]] |]'
  - The scalar triple product of three position vectors is the volume of the parallelepiped
    built from the vectors with a sign depending on the space orientation.
