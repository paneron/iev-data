  definition: neutron multiplication in a subcritical medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Ratio of the total number of neutrons resulting from nuclear fission and a radioactive
    source, which exist in equilibrium in a subcritical assembly, to the total number
    of neutrons which would exist in the assembly due to the radioactive source in
    the absence of nuclear fission.
  - For critical assemblies this term does not have a useful meaning.
