  examples: []
  notes:
  - An example of conversion factor is km/m = 1 000 and thus 1 km = 1 000 m
  - 'The units may belong to different system of units. Examples are:


    • h/s = 3 600 and thus 1 h = 3 600 s;


    • (km/h)/(m/s) = (km/m)/(h/s) = (1 000/3 600) = (1/3,6), and thus 1 km/h = (1/3,6)
    m/s.'
