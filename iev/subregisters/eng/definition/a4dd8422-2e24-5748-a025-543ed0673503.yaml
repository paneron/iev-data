  definition: '{{electric line, IEV:151-12-27}} with one or more conductors or a cable
    supported above ground by appropriate means'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An overhead line may consist of only one conductor when the circuit is closed
    by the Earth.
  - An overhead line may be constructed with bare conductors, generally supported
    by insulators, or with insulated conductors.
  - The concept of overhead line generally includes the supporting elements.
