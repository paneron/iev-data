  definition: distance from a radio station in a given direction beyond which {{radio-frequency
    interference, IEV:161-01-14}} to, or from, other radio stations sharing the same
    {{frequency band, IEV:103-09-01}} can be neglected for planning purposes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, a coordination distance can be defined for an {{Earth station, IEV:713-02-05}}
    or a {{terrestrial station, IEV:713-02-04}}, but not for a {{space station, IEV:713-02-06}}.
