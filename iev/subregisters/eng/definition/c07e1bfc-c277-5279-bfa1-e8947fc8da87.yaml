  definition: scalar quantity equal to the tangential component dstem:[F]~t~ of a
    force acting on a surface element divided by the area dstem:[A] of the element,
    thus stem:[Ï„] = dstem:[F]~t~ / dstem:[A]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 In anisotropic media, shear stress may depend on the orientation of the surface
    and may be described by tensor.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of shear stress is pascal, Pa.
