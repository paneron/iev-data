  definition: set of equations relating the four vector quantities determining the
    electromagnetic field in a material medium or in vacuum and the two quantities
    electric current density and volumic electric charge
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The Maxwell equations expressed in differential form are:


    stem:[rot E = - ((del B))/((del t))]


    stem:[div D = rho]


    stem:[rot H = J + ((del D))/((del t))]


    stem:[div B = 0]


    where *rot* and div denote the rotation and the divergence respectively, stem:[*E*]
    , stem:[*D*] , stem:[*H*]  and stem:[*B*]  are the four vector quantities determining
    the electromagnetic field,  stem:[*J*] is the electric current density, stem:[œÅ]  is
    the volumic electric charge and stem:[t] is the time.'
  - The Maxwell equations completely define the electromagnetic field in a given medium
    only together with the relations characterizing the medium, often called constitutive
    relations; in the case of a linear medium, these relations are expressed in terms
    of the permittivity, permeability, and conductivity of the medium.
