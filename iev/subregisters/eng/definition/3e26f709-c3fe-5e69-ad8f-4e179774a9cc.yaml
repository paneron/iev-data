  definition: frequency-domain measure of the short-term frequency stability of an
    oscillator
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'This phase noise is normally expressed as the power spectral density of the phase
    fluctuations, stem:[S_(varphi) ( f )], where the phase fluctuation function is
    stem:[varphi ( t ) = 2 pi F t - 2 pi F_0 t]. The spectral density of phase fluctuation
    can be directly related to the spectral density of frequency fluctuation by the
    following formula:


    stem:[S_(varphi) ( f ) = ( ((F_0))/(f) ) S_y ( f ) rad^2 //Hz]


    In the preceding formulae:


    stem:[F] is the oscillator frequency;


    stem:[F]~0~ is the average oscillator frequency;


    stem:[f] is the Fourier frequency.'
