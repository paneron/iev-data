  definition: criterion to determine the critical current, stem:[I]~c~, based on the
    electric field strength, stem:[E], or the resistivity, stem:[ρ]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[E] = 10 μV/m or stem:[E] = 100 μV/m is often used as electric field criterion,
    and stem:[ρ] = 10^−14^ Ω·m or stem:[ρ] = 10^−13^ Ω·m is often used as resistivity
    criterion.
