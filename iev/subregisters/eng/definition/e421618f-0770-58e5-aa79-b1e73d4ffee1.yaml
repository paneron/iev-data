  definition: 'mean value of the {{conditional information content, IEV:171-07-21}}
    of the events in a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events,
    given the occurrence of the events in another set of mutually exclusive and jointly
    exhaustive events


    stem:[H ( X | Y ) = sum_((i = 1))^n sum_((j = 1))^m p ( x_i , y_j ) * I ( x_i
    | y_j )]


    where stem:[X = { x_1 , ... , x_n }] is the set of events stem:[x_i ( i = 1, ...
    , n )], stem:[Y = { y_1 , ... , y_m }] is the set of events stem:[y_j ( j = 1,
    ... , m )], stem:[I ( x_i | y_j )] is the conditional information content of stem:[x_i]
    given stem:[y_j], and stem:[p ( x_i , y_j )] the joint probability that both events
    occur'
