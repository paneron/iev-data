  definition: superconductor in which superconductivity appears with perfect diamagnetism
    below the critical field strength, stem:[H]~c~, but disappears above stem:[H]~c~,
    when demagnetization factor is zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a uniformly magnetized body, the demagnetization factor is the ratio of the
    self-magnetization field strength to the magnetization ({{121-12-63, IEV:121-12-63}}).
