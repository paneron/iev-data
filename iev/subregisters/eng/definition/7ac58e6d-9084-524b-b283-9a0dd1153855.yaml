  definition: quotient of that part of the illuminance at a point on a given plane
    in an interior which is received directly from internal reflecting surfaces illuminated
    directly or indirectly by a sky of assumed or known luminance distribution and
    the illuminance on a horizontal plane due to an unobstructed hemisphere of this
    sky, where the contribution of direct sunlight to both illuminances is excluded
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When calculating the lighting of interiors, the contribution of direct sunlight
    has to be considered separately.
  - The internally reflected component of daylight factor has unit one.
