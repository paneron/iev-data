  definition: factor describing the protective quality of a sunscreen against solar
    <a href="IEV845-21-008">ultraviolet radiation</a>, normally determined by in vivo
    testing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The sun protection factor is usually determined by comparing the dose of ultraviolet
    radiation from a solar simulator (often a xenon lamp) required to produce just-perceptible
    actinic erythema approximately 24 h after exposure in ultraviolet-irradiated human
    volunteers, with and without a standard amount of the sunscreen being present
    (F~MED,f~ and F~MED,i~, respectively) and is calculated as follows:


    stem:[F]~SP~ = stem:[F]~MED,f~ / stem:[F]~MED,i~.'
  - The sun protection factor can also be determined by equivalent in vitro methods.
  - The sun protection factor has unit one.
