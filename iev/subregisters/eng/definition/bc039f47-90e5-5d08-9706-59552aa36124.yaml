  definition: '{{electrochemical surface area, IEV:485-02-09}} per unit mass (or volume)
    of the {{catalyst, IEV:485-01-01}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The specific surface area corresponds to the area of an {{electrocatalyst, IEV:485-01-02}}
    accessible to reactants owing to its open porous structure, per unit mass (or
    volume) of the catalyst.
  - The specific surface area is expressed in m^2^/g or m^2^/m^3^.
