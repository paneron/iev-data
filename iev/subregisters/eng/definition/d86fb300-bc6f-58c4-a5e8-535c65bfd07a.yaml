  definition: production process of a superconducting thin film in which the first
    step is a low temperature deposition of a precursor film by PVD and the second
    step is a high temperature annealing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "ex-situ process" is also used for a production process of MgB~2~ wires
    in which reacted MgB~2~ powders are filled in a metal tube and then drawn to wire.
