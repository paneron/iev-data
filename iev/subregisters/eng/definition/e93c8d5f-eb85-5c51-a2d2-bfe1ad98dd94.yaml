  definition: vision by the normal eye in which rods are the principal active photoreceptors
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Scotopic vision normally occurs when the eye is adapted to levels of luminance
    of less than 0,005 cd·m^−2^.
  - In comparison with photopic vision, scotopic vision is characterized by the lack
    of colour perception and by a shift of the visual sensitivity function towards
    shorter wavelengths.
