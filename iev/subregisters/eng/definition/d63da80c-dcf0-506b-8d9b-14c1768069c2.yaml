data:
  definition: an elliptically or circularly-polarized wave in which the electric field
    strength vector, observed in any fixed plane normal to the direction of propagation,
    whilst looking in this direction, rotates with time in a left-hand or counterclockwise
    sense
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a left-hand circularly-polarized plane wave; the ends of the electric vectors
    drawn from any points along a straight line normal to the plane of the wave front,
    form, at any instant, a right-hand helix.
