  definition: number the product of which by the reduced Planck constant is the value
    of the component of the spin ({{113-05-09, IEV:113-05-09}}) onto a quantization
    axis
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 In the quantization direction stem:[z], the component of the spin is quantized
    as stem:[S]~stem:[z]~ = stem:[m]~stem:[s]~stem:[ħ], stem:[m]~stem:[s]~ = stem:[s],
    stem:[s] − 1, …, − stem:[s], where stem:[m]~stem:[s]~ is spin magnetic quantum
    number and stem:[s] is spin quantum number.
  - 2 The quantization direction often can be chosen arbitrarily. In the presence
    of a magnetic field, the best choice for the quantization axis is the direction
    of the magnetic flux density.
