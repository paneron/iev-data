  definition: coercive field strength in a substance when either the magnetic flux
    density or the magnetic polarization and magnetization is brought from its value
    at magnetic saturation to zero by monotonic reduction of the applied magnetic
    field strength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The quantity which is brought to zero should be stated, and the appropriate symbol
    used: stem:[HcB], stem:[HcJ] or stem:[HcM]  for the coercivity relating to the
    magnetic flux density, the magnetic polarization or the magnetization respectively,
    where stem:[HcJ] = stem:[HcM].'
