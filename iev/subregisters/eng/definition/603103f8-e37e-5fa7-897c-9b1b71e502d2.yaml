  definition: operation performed on a set for which an addition is defined, usually
    denoted by the minus symbol −, the result of which, for elements stem:[a] and
    stem:[b] of the set, is the unique element stem:[a] − stem:[b], if it exists in
    the set, such that stem:[b] + (stem:[a] − stem:[b]) = stem:[a]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Subtraction is defined for integers and extended to other classes of numbers and
    to mathematical entities such as vectors and matrices, and also to quantities
    of the same kind.
  - The subtraction of entities stem:[a] and stem:[b] can be defined by stem:[a] −
    stem:[b] = stem:[a] + (−stem:[b]) where −stem:[b] is the negative of stem:[b].
  - The subtraction of entities stem:[a] and stem:[b] is expressed by the words "stem:[a]
    minus stem:[b]".
