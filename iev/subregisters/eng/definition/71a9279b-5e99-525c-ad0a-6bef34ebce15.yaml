  definition: 'the quantity which characterizes that part of profile dispersion due
    to a variation of refractive index contrast with wavelength given by:


    stem:[P ( lambda ) = ((n_((1 )) lambda d Delta))/((N_1 Delta d lambda))]


    where


    stem:[n]~1~ is the maximum refractive index of the core,


    stem:[N]~1~ is the group index corresponding to stem:[n]~1~ calculated from the
    formula:


    stem:[N]~1~ = stem:[n]~1~ = stem:[λ] (dstem:[n]~1~ / dstem:[λ])


    Δ is the refractive index contrast,


    stem:[λ] is the wavelength in vacuum'
