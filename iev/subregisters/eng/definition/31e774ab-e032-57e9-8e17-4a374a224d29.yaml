    these being functional units for data processing, via a common transmission path,
    wherein participants are not involved in the transfer of data between other participants
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The logic and functional definition of a bus applies independently of the topological
    configuration and physical implementation of the bus. A bus may have a line or
    a ring configuration.
  - In some cases, transmission rights are distributed by another participant, for
    example by a bus arbitrator.
