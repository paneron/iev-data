  definition: the temperature, usually expressed in kelvins, of a resistor having
    an available thermal noise power per unit bandwidth equal to that at the output
    port of a given antenna at a specified frequency and in specified conditions of
    installation and operation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The noise temperature of an antenna depends on the intrinsic noise of the antenna
    and on noise from external sources.
