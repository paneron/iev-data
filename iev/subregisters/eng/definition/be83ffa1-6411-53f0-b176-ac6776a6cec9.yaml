  definition: difference between the highest and lowest points within each site of
    a clamped wafer
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A site map example is shown in Figure 23. The value is always a positive number
    and is defined for each site as the difference between the highest and lowest
    points within each site, as shown in Figure 24. For a wafer to meet a local thickness
    variation specification, all sites must have local thickness variation values
    less than the specified value.
