  definition: unit of quantum information in a quantum computing system consisting
    of superconducting circuits including Josephson junctions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Superconducting qubits are classified into three different types depending on
    which quantum degrees of freedom they utilize. The first one uses states determined
    by the number of Cooper pairs (charge qubit), the second one uses direction of
    a persistent circulating current in a superconducting loop (flux qubit), and the
    third one uses states determined by quantum oscillation of the phase difference
    between electrodes of a Josephson junction (phase qubit).
