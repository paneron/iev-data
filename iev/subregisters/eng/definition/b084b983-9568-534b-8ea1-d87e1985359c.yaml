  definition: scattering of radiation by material through angles greater than 90Â°
    with respect to its initial direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In radiotherapy, it is particularly applied to radiation scattered back to the
    skin from underlying tissues. In measurements of radioactivity, it applies to
    the scattering of particles into the measuring device by the material on which
    the sample is mounted.
