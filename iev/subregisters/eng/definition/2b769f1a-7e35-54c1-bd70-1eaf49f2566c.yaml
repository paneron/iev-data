  definition: basic constituent particle of any substance, electrically neutral, consisting
    of a single central part having a positive electric charge and nearly all the
    mass, surrounded by electrons
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The motions and combinations of atoms explain macroscopic properties of the
    substance.
  - 2 If an atom loses or accepts one or more electrons, it becomes an ion.
  - 3 The electric charge of the central part, called atomic nucleus, determines the
    number of electrons; and by this the chemical behaviour of the atom, i.e. its
    ability to produce combinations with other atoms. A chemical element consists
    of atoms, the atomic nuclei of which have the same number of protons.
