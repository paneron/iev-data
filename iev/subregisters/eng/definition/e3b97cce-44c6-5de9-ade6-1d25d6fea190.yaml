data:
  definition: one of the two frequencies of a piezoelectric resonator in association
    with a series or parallel load capacitance, under specified conditions, at which
    the electrical impedance of the combination is resistive
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The load resonance frequency is the lower of the two frequencies when the load
    capacitance is in series and the higher when it is in parallel.
  - This entry was numbered 561-02-12 in IEC 60050-561:1991.
