  definition: technique for plethysmography in which the volume changes are indicated
    by changes in the electrical impedance between appropriately positioned surface
    electrodes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The impedance is generally measured at a high frequency in order to avoid undesirable
    physiological effects.
