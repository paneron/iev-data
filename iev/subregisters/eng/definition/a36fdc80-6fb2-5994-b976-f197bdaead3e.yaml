  definition: logarithm of the ratio of a given sound pressure to the reference sound
    pressure of 20 μPa, the sound pressure being obtained with a standard frequency
    weighting and with a standard exponential time weighting. Sound level in decibels
    is twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of that ratio
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Standard frequency weightings A, В and C and standard exponential time weightings
    fast (F), slow (S) and impulse (I) are given in IEC 651 (1979): Sound level meters.'
  - Time and frequency weightings employed should be specified, but if not stated
    explicitly, fast (F) exponential time weighting and A-frequency weighting are
    understood.
