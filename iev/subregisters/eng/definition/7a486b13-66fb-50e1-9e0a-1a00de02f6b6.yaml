    carrier frequency or another characteristic frequency of an input radio-frequency
    signal in a signal resulting from each frequency translation

  notes:

    frequencies.
  - This expression or the abbreviation “IF” is used to identify the frequency band
    translated from the radio-frequency band or a device operating in this band.
