  notes:
  - The definition of “safety” in combination with other words may gradually (as in
    “product safety”, “machinery safety”) or completely (as in “workers safety”, “safety
    belt” or “functional safety”) change. For the use of the word safety, see IEC
    Guide 51, Clause 4. [ISO/IEC Guide 2, _Standardization and related activities
    – General vocabulary_]
  - In standardization the safety of products, processes and services is generally
    considered with a view to achieving the optimum balance of a number of factors,
    including non-technical factors such as human behaviour, that will eliminate avoidable
    risks of harm to persons and goods to an acceptable degree. [ISO/IEC Guide 2]
  - In many other languages than English there is only one word for safety and security.
