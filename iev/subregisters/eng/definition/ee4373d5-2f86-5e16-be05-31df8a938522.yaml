  definition: phenomenon associated with the failure of insulation under electrical
    stress which includes a collapse of voltage and the passage of current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term applies to electric breakdown in solid, liquid and gaseous dielectrics
    and combination of these.
  - A disruptive discharge in a solid dielectric produces permanent loss of dielectric
    strength; in a liquid or gaseous dielectric the loss may be temporary only.
