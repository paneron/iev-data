  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of inertial
    and gravitational forces in a flow of fluid, defined by stem:[F r = (v)/((sqrt(l
    g)))], where stem:[v] is the speed of the flow, stem:[l] is a characterizing length
    of the phenomenon, and stem:[g] is acceleration of free fall
