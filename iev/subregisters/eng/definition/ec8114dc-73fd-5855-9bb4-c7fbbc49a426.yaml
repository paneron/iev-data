  definition: quotient of dstem:[N/]dstem:[a], where dstem:[N] is the number of particles
    incident on a cross-sectional area dstem:[a]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The numerical value of particle fluence is the same as the numerical value of
    the time integral of the particle flux.
  - Normally the use of the term particle refers to a specific elementary particle,
    for example neutron fluence. This quantity is expressed in particles divided by
    area (m^−2^, cm^−2^).
