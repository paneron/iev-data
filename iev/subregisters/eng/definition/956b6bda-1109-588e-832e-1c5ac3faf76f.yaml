  definition: 'for a linear passive two-terminal-pair network terminated with its
    image impedances, half the natural logarithm of the product of the phasors <u>stem:[U]</u>~1~
    and <u>stem:[I]</u>~1~ representing the voltage and the electric current at the
    input divided by the product of the phasors <u>stem:[U]</u>~2~ and <u>stem:[I]</u>~2~
    representing the voltage and the current at the output:


    stem:[(1)/(2) ln (((underset(_)(U))_1 (underset(_)(I))_1))/(((underset(_)(U))_2
    (underset(_)(I))_2))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The imaginary part of the logarithm must be appropriately chosen.
