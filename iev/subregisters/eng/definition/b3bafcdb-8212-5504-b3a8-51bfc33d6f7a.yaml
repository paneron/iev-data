  definition: curve showing the counting rate as a function of the voltage applied
    to a radiation detector in a radiation field with all other parameters constant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This curve is a characteristic of all detectors operating in the current and pulse
    modes.
  - For detectors operating in current mode the characteristic is the saturation curve.
