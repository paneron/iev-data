data:
  definition: the ratio of the magnitude of the phase velocity of a sinusoidal wave
    to the frequency of the wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The wavelength has its minimum value in the direction of propagation;   if no
    direction is specified, the wavelength is that in the direction of propagation.
