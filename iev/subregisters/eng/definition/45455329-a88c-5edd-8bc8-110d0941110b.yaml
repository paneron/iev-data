  definition: production process of a superconductor directly formed on the surface
    of a tape or wire
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The superconductor is usually formed by dipping or some other surface coating
    process, such as electroplating, and a subsequent heat treatment causes interdiffusion
    and reaction of the coating and the base metal to form the superconducting compound.
