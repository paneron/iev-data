  definition: representative value of a {{signal, IEV:701-01-02}} at a chosen {{instant,
    IEV:113-01-08}} obtained from the values of that signal near this instant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Ideally, the representative value of a signal is equal to the value of the signal
    at a chosen instant; in practice it is equal or proportional to a weighted average
    of the varying value of the signal near this instant.
