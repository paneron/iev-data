  definition: complex representation stem:[underset(_)(a) ( alpha , t ) = A_0 exp
    j ( omega t - p alpha + vartheta_0 )] of a rotating sinusoidal field quantity,
    where stem:[A_0] is the amplitude, stem:[ω] is the angular frequency, stem:[t]
    is time, stem:[p] is an integer, stem:[α] is angular position, stem:[vartheta_0]
    is initial phase, and j is the imaginary unit
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept of space phasor is used for electric rotating machines.
