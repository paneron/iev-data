data:
  definition: superconductor which exists in the Meissner state when the magnetic
    field strength is below the lower critical field strength, stem:[H]~c1~, exists
    in the mixed state for the field between stem:[H]~c1~ and the upper critical field
    strength, stem:[H]~c2~, and exists in the normal state above stem:[H]~c2~, when
    demagnetization factor is zero
