  definition: illuminant standardized by the CIE for the purpose of harmonization
  examples:
  - 'Examples of CIE standard illuminants are:* CIE standard illuminant A: relative
    spectral distribution of radiant flux based on Planckian radiation at a temperature
    of about 2 855,5 K;* CIE standard illuminant D65: relative spectral distribution
    of radiant flux representing a phase of daylight with a correlated colour temperature
    of approximately 6 500 K (called also "nominal correlated colour temperature of
    the daylight illuminant").'
  notes:
  - CIE standard illuminants should be used whenever appropriate in order to facilitate
    the comparison of published results.
  - See also CIE 15, stem:[Colorimetry].
  - 'See also ISO 11664-2/CIE S 014-2, _Colorimetry â€“ Part 2: CIE Standard llluminants
    for Colorimetry_, in which examples are given for applications of use of CIE standard
    illuminants.'
  - Illuminants B, C and other <a href="IEV845-23-020">daylight illuminants</a>, previously
    denoted as "standard illuminants", should now be termed "<a href="IEV845-23-019">CIE
    illuminants</a>".
