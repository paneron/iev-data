  definition: 'symbolic notation expressed formally as a scalar, operating at each
    point of a given space region on scalars or vectors, and which, in orthonormal
    Cartesian coordinates, is represented by


    stem:[Delta = ((del^2))/((del x^2)) + ((del^2))/((del y^2)) + ((del^2))/((del
    z^2))]'
