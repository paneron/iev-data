  definition: '1. in theory, a mutually synchronized network in which all the clocks
    are of equal status and directly exert equal amounts of control on all the other
    clocks


    2. in practice, a mutually synchronized network in which all the clocks are of
    equal status and in which each clock directly exerts equal amounts of control
    on a few other clocks'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the theoretical case, the network operating frequency or digit rate is the
    mean of the natural frequencies of all the clocks.
