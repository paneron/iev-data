data:
  definition: in an optical fibre, a mode whose field decays monotonically in the
    transverse direction everywhere external to the core and which does not lose power
    to radiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Where the refractive index decreases with distance from the axis and where there
    is no central refractive index dip a bound mode is one for which :


    stem:[n](stem:[a])stem:[k] ≤ stem:[β] ≤ stem:[n](0)stem:[k]


    where stem:[β] is the imaginary part (phase coefficient) of the axial propagation
    coefficient,


    stem:[n](stem:[a]) is the refractive index at stem:[r] = stem:[a], the radius,


    stem:[n](0) is the refractive index at stem:[r] = 0,


    stem:[k] is the angular free space wavenumber 2 π/λ and λ is the wavelength.'
  - Bound modes correspond to guided light rays in the terminology of geometric optics.
  - In a multimode fibre, the power in bound modes is predominantly contained in the
    core of the fibre.
