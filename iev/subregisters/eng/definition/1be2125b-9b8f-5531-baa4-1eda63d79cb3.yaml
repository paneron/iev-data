  definition: electrical insulation material, which is extruded or moulded, but not
    poured
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Insulators fabricated from two or more pieces of electrical insulating material
    that are solidly bonded together can be considered as solid. The term "solid insulation"
    describes the final form and not necessarily the form in which they are initially
    applied. For windings of electrical machines, the process of using varnish as
    a means of consolidating and insulating the winding is considered to result in
    solid insulation, irrespective of how the varnish is applied.
