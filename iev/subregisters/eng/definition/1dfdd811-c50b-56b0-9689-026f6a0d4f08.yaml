  definition: qualifying two time-varying phenomena, time-scales, or signals characterized
    by corresponding significant instants which are separated by time intervals of
    a constant desired duration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, any variations of the time intervals are constrained within specified
    limits.
  - Two phenomena, time-scales, or signals may be synchronous without being isochronous.
  - For periodic phenomena, time-scales or signals, the corresponding significant
    instants occur at the same average rate.
