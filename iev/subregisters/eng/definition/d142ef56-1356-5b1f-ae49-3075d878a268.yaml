  definition: surface adjacent to a {{hot functional surface, IEV:903-03-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The adjacent surface and the hot functional surface normally consist of the same
    piece of material, or are in direct thermal contact, and have similar thermal
    properties. The adjacent surface is not heated intentionally during use of the
    product. However, as it is adjacent to the hot functional surface and may become
    hot through conduction, its temperature will be in the range between the hot functional
    surface and a {{touchable surface, IEV:903-03-04}}.
