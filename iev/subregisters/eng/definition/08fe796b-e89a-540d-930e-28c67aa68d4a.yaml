  examples: []
  notes:
  - Fagan inspection is a fault removal technique, performed by organised teams, and
    is an example of verification.
  - 'The levels at which Fagan inspection is normally carried out are: comparison
    of design with specification, comparison of detailed design with high-level design,
    and comparison of source code with detailed design. Test plans are also inspected
    against design documents.'
