  definition: system of units, based on a given system of quantities, in which the
    unit of measurement for each derived quantity is a coherent derived unit
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A system of units can be coherent only with respect to a system of quantities
    and the adopted base units.
  - For a coherent system of units, numerical value equations have the same form,
    including numerical factors, as the corresponding quantity equations.
  - An example of coherent system of units is the set of coherent SI units with the
    relations between them.
