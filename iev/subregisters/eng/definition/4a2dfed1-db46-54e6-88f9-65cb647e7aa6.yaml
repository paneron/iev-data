  definition: unwanted {{oscillation, IEV:103-05-04}} produced in equipment at a {{frequency,
    IEV:103-06-02}} independent both of the operating frequencies and of frequencies
    related to the generation of desired oscillations
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A parasitic oscillation of a {{radio transmitter, IEV:713-08-01}} can produce
