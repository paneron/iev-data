        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified

  definition: '{{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} of a set of events when they are equiprobable,
    i.e. stem:[p](stem:[x]~stem:[i]~) &amp;equals; 1/stem:[n] for stem:[i] &amp;equals;
    1, …, stem:[n]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the same integer base is used for the same number of events, the maximum
    entropy equals the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}}.
