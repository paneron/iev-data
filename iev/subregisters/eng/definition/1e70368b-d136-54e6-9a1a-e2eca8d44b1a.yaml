  definition: image state associated with colour image data that represent the colour
    space coordinates of the elements of a two-dimensional <a href="IEV845-32-045">hardcopy</a>
    or <a href="IEV845-32-046">softcopy</a>, typically produced by scanning artwork,
    photographic transparencies or prints, or photomechanical or other reproductions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the phrase "original-referred" is used as a qualifier to an object, it implies
    that the object is in an original-referred image state. For example, original-referred
    image data are image data in an original-referred image state.
  - Original-referred image data are related to the colour space coordinates of the
    original, typically measured in accordance with ISO 13655, _Graphic technology
    â€“ Spectral measurement and colorimetric computation for graphic arts images_,
    and do not include any additional veiling glare or other flare.
  - The characteristics of original-referred image data that most generally distinguish
    them from scene-referred image data are that they are referred to a 2-dimensional
    surface, and the illumination incident on the 2-dimensional surface is assumed
    to be uniform (or the image data corrected for any non-uniformity in the illumination).
  - There are classes of originals that produce original-referred image data with
    different characteristics. Examples include various types of artwork, photographic
    prints, photographic transparencies, and emissive displays. When selecting a colour
    re-rendering algorithm, it is usually necessary to know the class of the original
    in order to determine the appropriate colour re-rendering to be applied. For example,
    a colorimetric intent is generally applied to artwork, while different perceptual
    algorithms are applied to produce photographic prints from transparencies, or
    newsprint reproductions from photographic prints. In some cases the assumed viewing
    conditions are also different between the original classes, such as between photographic
    prints and transparencies, and will usually be considered in well-designed systems.
  - In a few cases, it can be desirable to introduce slight colorimetric errors in
    the production of original-referred image data, for example to make the gamut
    of the original more closely fit the colour space, or because of the way the image
    data were captured (such as a Status A densitometry-based scanner).
