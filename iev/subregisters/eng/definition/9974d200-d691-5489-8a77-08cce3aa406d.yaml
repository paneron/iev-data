data:
  definition: the lowest frequency that would permit acceptable performance of a radio
    circuit by signal propagation via the ionosphere between given terminals below
    the ionosphere at a given time, under specified working conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Acceptable performance may for example be quoted in terms of maximum error ratio
    or required signal/noise ratio.
  - Specified working conditions may include such factors as antenna types, transmitter
    power, class of emission and required information rate.
