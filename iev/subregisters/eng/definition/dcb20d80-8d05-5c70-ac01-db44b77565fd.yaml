  definition: 'a unidirectional pulse defined as a function of time stem:[t] by the
    expressions:


    stem:[y] = k sin^2^ (stem:[π t]/2stem:[T]) for 0 ≤ stem:[t] ≤ 2stem:[T]


    stem:[y] = 0 for stem:[t] &lt;0 and stem:[t] &gt; 2stem:[T]


    where:


    stem:[y] is the instantaneous value of the characteristic quantity,


    k is the peak value of the pulse,


    2stem:[T] is the duration of the pulse, stem:[T] being the length of time during
    which the characteristic quantity is greater than k/2'
