  definition: fundamental physical constant equal to the product of the elementary
    electric charge stem:[e] and the Avogadro constant stem:[N]~A~, thus stem:[F]
    = stem:[eN]~A~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The value of the Faraday constant is 96 485,339 9(24) Ã— 10^3^ C/mol (CODATA
    2006).
  - 2 The Faraday constant is numerically equal to the electric charge of 1 mol of
    protons
