  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,



    . for stem:[n] quantities stem:[x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n], by the quotient of the sum
    of the quantities by stem:[n]:


    stem:[bar X = (1)/(n) ( x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n )]


    .  for a quantity stem:[x] depending on a variable stem:[t], by the integral of
    the quantity taken between two given values of the variable, divided by the difference
    of the two values:


    stem:[bar X = (1)/((t_2 - t_1)) int_( t_1)^( t_2) x ( t ) d t]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The mean value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration interval
    the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The mean value of the quantity stem:[x] may be denoted by stem:[bar X], by 〈stem:[X]〉,
    or by stem:[X]~a~. Subscripts ar, av and moy are also used.
  - The adjective "arithmetic" is only used to qualify the terms "mean" and "average"
    in order to distinguish them from the terms "geometric mean" and "geometric average",
    as well from "harmonic mean" and "harmonic average".
  - The mean value can be generalized for a function of stem:[n] variables, e.g. with
    a surface integral or an integral over a three-dimensional domain divided by the
    corresponding area or volume. See the examples in IEC 60050-102.
