  definition: "operation performed on a set, assigning a unique element of the set\
    \ to any ordered pair of elements stem:[a] and stem:[b] of the set, with the following\
    \ properties:\n\n\n\n* associativity: stem:[a * ( b * c ) = ( a * b ) * c], where\
    \ stem:[c] is also an element of the set, \n\n* if an addition is performed on\
    \ the set, distributivity: stem:[a * ( b + c ) = a * b + a * c] and stem:[( a\
    \ + b ) * c = a * c + b * c]"

  notes:
  - Multiplication is defined for natural numbers and extended to other classes of
    numbers and to mathematical entities such as polynomials and matrices. Multiplication
    is also defined for quantities and units, even if they are not of the same kind,
    so that addition cannot be defined.
  - Multiplication is not necessarily commutative, for example in the case of matrices.
  - Each element in a multiplication of two or more elements is called a factor. The
    term "factor" is also used for a quotient of two quantities of the same kind (see
    {{IEV 112-01-04, IEV:112-01-04}}). In the multiplication of two elements, the
    first is called "multiplier" and the second "multiplicator".
  - The multiplication of entities stem:[a] and stem:[b] is expressed by the words
    "stem:[a] multiplied by stem:[b]" or "stem:[a] times stem:[b]" and denoted by
    stem:[a] ⋅ stem:[b], stem:[a] × stem:[b], or stem:[ab]. The symbol ∏ is used to
    denote successive multiplications, for example stem:[a]~2~ ⋅ stem:[a]~3~ ⋅ stem:[a]~4~
    ⋅ stem:[a]~5~ ⋅ stem:[a]~6~ ⋅ stem:[a]~7~ is denoted by stem:[prod_((i = 2))^7
    a_i].
