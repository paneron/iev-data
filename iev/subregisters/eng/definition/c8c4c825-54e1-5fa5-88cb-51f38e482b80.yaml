        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: 'ratio of the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} stem:[H] to the {{decision
    content, IEV:171-07-10}} stem:[H]~0~


    stem:[H]~r~ &amp;equals;  stem:[H]/stem:[H]~0~'
  examples:
  - 'Let stem:[{ a , b , c }] be a set of three events and let stem:[p ( a ) = 0,5],
    stem:[p ( b ) = 0,25] and stem:[p ( c ) = 0,25] be the probabilities of their
    occurrences. The relative entropy of this set is: stem:[H_r = 1,5 Sh // 1,585
    Sh tildetilde 0,95].'
