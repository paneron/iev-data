  definition: ratio of the sum of {{net electric power, IEV:485-14-03}} and total
    useable exergy flow of recovered heat to the total exergy flow supplied to the
    {{fuel cell power system, IEV:485-09-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The supplied total exergy flow of the {{raw fuel, IEV:485-07-01}} (including that
    created by any reactions) should be related to a gaseous product for a better
