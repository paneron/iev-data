  definition: for a cross-section of an optical fibre the area within which the refractive
    index everywhere (excluding any index dip) exceeds that of the innermost homogeneous
    cladding by a given fraction of the difference between the maximum of the refractive
    index of the core and the refractive index of the innermost homogenous cladding
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The core area is the smallest cross-sectional area of a fibre excluding any index
    dip, which is contained within the locus of points where the refractive index
    stem:[n]~3~ is given by:


    stem:[n]~3~ = stem:[n]~2~ + stem:[k] (stem:[n]~1~ – stem:[n]~2~)


    where:


    stem:[n]~1~ is maximum refractive index of the core,


    stem:[n]~2~ is refractive index of the innermost homogeneous cladding,


    stem:[k] is a constant (usually taken to be in the range 0 – 0,05).'
