data:
  definition: switching element the output variable of which reproduces a change in
    the input variable from 0 to 1 delayed by the time interval of duration stem:[t]~1~
    and a change from 1 to 0 delayed by the time interval of duration stem:[t]~2~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term delay has here another meaning than for continuous transfer elements.
  - Depending on the application, either the switch-on delay time stem:[t]~1~ or the
    switch-off delay time stem:[t]~2~ or both may be used.
  - In many applications the output variable remains at the value 0 if the duration
    of the time interval stem:[t]~0~ during which the input variable has the value
    1 is shorter than the duration of the switch-on time interval stem:[t]~1~.
