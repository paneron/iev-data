  definition: assembly of components that ensures intrinsic safety of a circuit by
    the use of shunt components
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The shunt component can be a resistor or a semiconductor safely diverting the
    current or limiting the voltage in an intrinsically safe circuit or the voltage
    at an energy-storing component.
