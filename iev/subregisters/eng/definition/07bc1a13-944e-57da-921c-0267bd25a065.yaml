data:
  definition: the process of routing messages in a telecommunication network, where
    the messages are first cut into addressed packets; in certain nodes of the network,
    these packets are received, stored and forwarded onto the appropriated transmission
    channels; at the receiving end, the message is reconstituted from the received
    packets
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A packet uses a transmission channel only during its transmission, so that the
    channel is later available for the transfer of other packets belonging either
    to the same message or to other messages
