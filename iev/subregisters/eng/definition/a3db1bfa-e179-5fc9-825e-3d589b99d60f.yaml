data:
  definition: the surface described by the extremity of a radius vector whose magnitude
    is a specified function of the magnitude of a component of the field produced
    by an antenna at a constant distance in the direction of the vector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The radiation pattern surface in the far-field region is most frequently considered.
  - In French, the term "surface de directivit√©" is the preferred term when the surface
    does not depend upon the power fed to the antenna.
