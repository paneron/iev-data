  definition: output-referred colour image data, which are referred to a standardized
    real or virtual output device and viewing conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Image data intended for open interchange are most commonly standard output-referred.
    This is because with standard output-referred image data it is generally sufficient
    to specify the standard output to which the image data are referred to interpret
    the colour appearance described by the image data.
  - Standard output-referred image data can become the starting point for a subsequent
    reproduction process. For example, sRGB standard output-referred image data are
    frequently considered to be the starting point for the <a href="IEV845-32-017">colour
    re-rendering</a> performed by a printer designed to receive sRGB image data.
