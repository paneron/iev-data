  definition: form of fault-tolerant software design in which several diverse versions
    of a program are executed in parallel and the majority output is selected
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The program versions are usually executed in separate processors.
  - Each version is capable of performing the given task. At least three versions
    are employed. A voter selects the result on which the majority of versions agree.
    If no majority exists, then the whole functional unit fails.
  - stem:[N]-version programming is an example of active redundancy, and is mostly
    used in avionics and process control systems.
