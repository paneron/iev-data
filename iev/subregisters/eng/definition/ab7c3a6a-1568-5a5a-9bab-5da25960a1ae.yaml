  definition: 'time integral of the voltage stem:[u]~AB~ ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}})
    between two terminals A and B of a two-terminal or stem:[n]-terminal element


    stem:[Psi ( t ) = int_((t_0))^t u_((AB)) ( tau ) d tau]


    where stem:[t]~0~ is any instant before the first supply of electric energy'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept is only useful in the case of an inductive element.
  - The definition of linked flux in circuit theory is consistent with the more general
    definition {{121-11-24, IEV:121-11-24}} given in electromagnetism. The linked
    flux in circuit theory is described by inverting the procedure for calculating
    induced voltage ({{121-11-28, IEV:121-11-28}}).
