  definition: a quasi-horizontal stratification in the troposphere within which radio
    energy of a sufficiently high frequency is substantially confined and propagates
    with much lower attenuation than would be obtained in a homogeneous atmosphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The tropospheric radio-duct consists of a ducting layer and, in the case of an
    elevated duct, a portion of the underlaying atmosphere.
