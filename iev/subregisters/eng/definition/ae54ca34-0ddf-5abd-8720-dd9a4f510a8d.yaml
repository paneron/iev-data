  definition: a transient phenomenon caused by a sudden variation of a signal at the
    input of a two port device and characterized by a temporary exaggeration of the
    values of the output signal above the steady state value that it should reach,
    generally followed by a damped oscillation around this steady state value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An overshoot may affect a step transition such as the leading edge or trailing
    edge of a pulse.
