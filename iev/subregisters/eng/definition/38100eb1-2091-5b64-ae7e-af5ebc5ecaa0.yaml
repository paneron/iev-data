  definition: any set of voltage levels lying between low and high voltage
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The boundaries between medium- and high-voltage levels overlap and depend on local
    circumstances and history or common usage. Nevertheless the band 30 kV to 100
    kV frequently contains the accepted boundary.
