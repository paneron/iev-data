  definition: a switching device designed to make or break the current in an electric
    circuit by means of the controlled conductivity of a semiconductor in that circuit
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a circuit where the current passes through zero (periodically or otherwise)
    the effect of "not making" the current following such a zero value is equivalent
    to breaking the current.
