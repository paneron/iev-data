      type: identical
  definition: current coordinate of the intersection between the maximum break-time–current
    characteristics of two overcurrent protective devices
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The take-over current is a limiting value of current above which, in the presence
    of two overcurrent protective devices in series, the protective device generally,
    but not necessarily, on the supply side, provides back-up operation for the other
    protective device.
  - '{{stem:[I]^2^stem:[t] characteristics, IEV:442-05-59}} can be used instead of
    time–current characteristics.'
