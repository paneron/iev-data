  definition: quantity-value scale defining a zero value of thermodynamic temperature
    by linear extrapolation based on the thermodynamic behaviour of an ideal gas and
    the triple point of water at 273,16 K
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The zero value of thermodynamic temperature describes the lowest energy state
    of a physical system, corresponding to all particles in rest in classical description,
    or to the ground state in quantum description. Then, both internal energy and
    entropy may be normalized to zero. The zero value of thermodynamic temperature
    may be approached but cannot be achieved.
