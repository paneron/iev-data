  notes:
  - In a microscopic region, materials such as single-crystal silicon, polysilicon,
    and so on are used for the diaphragm structure. The structure is commonly fabricated
    by {{anisotropic etching, IEV:523-05-09}}. The thickness of the structure can
    be controlled from several micrometres to several tens of micrometres depending
    on the application. The structure can be used to detect pressure changes, or to
    cause displacement. For example, it is used in the pressure-sensitive part of
    a pressure {{sensor, IEV:151-13-48}} for automobile engines and silicon microphones.
    Also, it is used as a membrane to change pressure in {{microvalves, IEV:523-04-17}}
    and {{micropumps, IEV:523-04-16}}.
