  definition: transfer element the behaviour of which obeys the principle of superposition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The principle of superposition implies that such a transfer element may be described
    by a set of linear equations.
  - A transfer element, which does not have this property, is called non-linear transfer
    element.
