  definition: thin film deposition technique at atomic-level resolution thickness
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By changing the precursor gases sequentially, a chemical deposition process can
    be controlled down to the atomic or molecular scale. In the molecular beam {{epitaxy,
    IEV:521-03-12}} process, one of the related techniques, the deposited layer has
    the same crystal structure as that of the mono-crystalline {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}}.
