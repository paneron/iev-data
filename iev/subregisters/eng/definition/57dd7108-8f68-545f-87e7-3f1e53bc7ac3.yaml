  definition: energy associated with motion, defined for a particle in classical mechanics
    by stem:[T = (1)/(2) m v^2], where stem:[m] is its mass and stem:[v] is its speed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The kinetic energy of a body is given by the integral stem:[T = (1)/(2) int_D
    v^2 d m,] where D is a domain containing the body. When the axis of rotation is
    through the centre of mass, stem:[T] is also given by stem:[T = (1)/(2) m_t v_G^2
    + (1)/(2) J omega^2], where stem:[m]~t~ is total mass, stem:[V]~G~ is speed of
    the centre of mass, stem:[J] is moment of inertia relative to the axis of rotation,
    and stem:[ω] is the magnitude of the angular velocity, and where stem:[v]~G~,
    stem:[J], and stem:[ω] can be time-dependent.
  - 2 In relativity, the dependence of the mass stem:[m] on the speed stem:[v] has
    to be considered.
