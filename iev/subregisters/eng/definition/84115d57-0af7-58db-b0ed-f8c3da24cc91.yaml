  - In French, the term "calculateur" can be used for any functional unit corresponding
    to the definition. The preferred term "ordinateur" is used for a digital computer
    controlled by programs placed into an internal device, also used for the associated
    digital data. Such digital computers are generally capable of executing user-designated
    programs and programs that modify themselves during their execution.
