  definition: an hypothetical radiating element consisting of a closed loop of vanishingly
    small dimensions traversed by a time-varying current having at any instant the
    same value at all points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The radiation from this element is the same as that from a fictitious time-varying
    magnetic current element perpendicular to the plane of the loop.
