  definition: impedance at a given frequency between a specified point in a system
    or in an installation or in equipment and reference earth
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Reference earth is defined in IEC 60050-195. In practice, a reference point can
    be substituted to earth, for example the chassis.
  - The common mode rejection ratio of an instrument is dependent on the impedances
    between the input terminals and earth. Each of these impedances is called a common
    mode impedance.
