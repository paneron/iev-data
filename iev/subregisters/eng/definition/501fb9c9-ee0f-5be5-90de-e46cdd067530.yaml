  definition: a reactor in which the magnetic circuit takes the form of columns (legs)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Since there are types of reactor which do not come clearly within the categories
    of "core-type" and "shell-type", the use of these terms is deprecated. Generally
    they can be avoided by indicating whether or not the magnetic circuit has unwound
    magnetic return paths.
