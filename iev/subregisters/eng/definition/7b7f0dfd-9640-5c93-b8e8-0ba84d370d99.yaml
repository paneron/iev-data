        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: aa5fca9b-ba16-503e-9b18-d8922399828d
  definition: 'amount by which the {{decision content, IEV:171-07-10}} stem:[H]~0~
    exceeds the {{entropy, IEV:171-07-15}} stem:[H]


    stem:[R] &amp;equals; stem:[H]~0~ − stem:[H]'
  examples:
  - 'Let stem:[{ a , b , c }] be a set of three events and let stem:[p ( a ) = 0,5],
    stem:[p ( b ) = 0,25] and stem:[p ( c ) = 0,25] be the probabilities of their
    occurrences. The redundancy of this set is: stem:[R = 1,585 Sh - 1,50 Sh = 0,085
    Sh].'
  notes:
  - Usually, messages can be represented with fewer characters by using suitable codes;
    the redundancy can be considered as a measure of the decrease of the average length
    of the messages accomplished by appropriate coding.
