  definition: 'relative change in length due to a change in thermodynamic temperature
    divided by the change in temperature


    stem:[alpha = ((l_T – l_((ref))))/((l_((ref)) ( T – T_((ref)) )))]


    where


    stem:[l]~stem:[T]~  is the length at temperature stem:[T];


    stem:[l]~ref~  is the length at reference temperature stem:[T]~ref~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is generally expressed in megakelvins
    to the power minus one (1/MK).
