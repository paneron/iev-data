  definition: constant in the catenary and parabola equations, geometrically represented
    by the radius of curvature at the lowest point of the span
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The catenary constant stem:[ρ] is equal to the quotient of the horizontal tension
    in the conductor stem:[T]~o~ at a given temperature (see Figure 466-1) by its
    unit weight stem:[ω], which must take into account the ice or wind overloads,
    if applicable.


    stem:[rho = ((T_o))/(omega)]'
