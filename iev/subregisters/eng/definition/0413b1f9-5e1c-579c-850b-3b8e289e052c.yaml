  definition: production process for conductors, where the superconductor is formed
    from its precursor material(s) in its final position in the conductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Cu/Nb or Cu/V mixtures in which Nb or V dendritically form from the melt are processed
    into wire or tape to give fine internal filamentary forms of Nb or V in a copper
    matrix, and Nb~3~Sn or V~3~Ga are formed by the diffusion process.
  - In-situ process includes also a production process of a superconducting thin film
    grown in a single step process.
  - In-situ process includes also a production process of MgB~2~ wires in which mixed
    powders of magnesium and boron or their compounds are filled in a metal tube with
    heat treatment for reaction after the drawing.
