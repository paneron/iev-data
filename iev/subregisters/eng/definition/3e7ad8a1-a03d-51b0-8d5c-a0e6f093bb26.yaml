  definition: logarithm of the ratio of a given sound pressure to the reference sound
    pressure of 20 ÂµPa, the sound pressure being obtained with a standard frequency
    weighting and with a standard exponential time weighting.
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Sound level in decibels is twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of that
    ratio.
  - 'Standard frequency weightings A and B used in IEC 61400-11 are given in IEC 60651
    (1979): Sound level meters.'
