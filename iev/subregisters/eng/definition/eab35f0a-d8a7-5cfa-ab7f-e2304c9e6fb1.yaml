        type: identical
  concept: 7e7b0a2a-fe2f-5561-bf8c-90f8404c7b49
  definition: maximum value of single-phase overcurrent which, in the absence of a
    residual current, can flow through a residual current device (whatever the number
    of poles) without causing it to operate
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of overcurrent in the main circuit, in the absence of residual current,
    operation of the detecting device can occur as a consequence of asymmetry existing
    in the detecting device itself.
