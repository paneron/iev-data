  definition: set of quantities together with a set of non-contradictory equations
    relating those quantities
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Ordinal quantities, such as Rockwell C hardness, are usually not considered to
    be part of a system of quantities because they are related to other quantities
    through empirical relations only. Nominal properties, such as colour of light,
    are not quantities and hence are not part of a system of quantities.
