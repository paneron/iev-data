  definition: the ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions
    for a given time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It is generally assumed that the item is in a state to perform this required function
    at the beginning of the time interval.
  - Generally, reliability performance is quantified using appropriate measures. In
    some applications, these measures include an expression of reliability performance
    as a probability, which is also called reliability.
