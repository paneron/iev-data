  definition: magnetic moment divided by the volume of the superconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The macroscopic magnetic moment is also equal to the product of the shielding
    current and the area of the closed path in a composite superconductor together
    with the magnetic moment of any penetrated trapped flux.
