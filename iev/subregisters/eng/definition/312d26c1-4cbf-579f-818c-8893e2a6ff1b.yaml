  definition: 'a dimensionless complex scalar quantity stem:[n], characteristic of
    a medium at a given point and in a given direction, when there can exist in the
    medium a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave whose wave vector stem:[vec underset(_)(K)]
    has colinear real and imaginary parts stem:[vec K^( '' )] and stem:[vec K^( ″
    )], in the given direction; this quantity is defined by the equation:


    stem:[vec underset(_)(K) = vec K^( '' ) + j vec K^( ″ ) = underset(_)(n) (omega)/((c_0))
    vec u]


    where stem:[ω] is the angular frequency, stem:[c]~0~ is the velocity of propagation
    of electromagnetic waves in vacuum and stem:[vec u] is the unit vector in the
    given direction'

  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium, the complex refractive index is the square root of the
    product of the relative complex permittivity and the relative complex permeability.
  - For each direction in an anisotropic medium, there are generally two distinct
    wave vectors and two values of the complex refractive index.
