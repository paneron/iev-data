  definition: '{{timescale, IEV:702-04-11}} consisting of a periodic repetition of
    {{cycles, IEV:103-05-08}} each of which is a succession of {{time intervals, IEV:113-01-10}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The individual time intervals comprising a single cycle need not all have the
    same {{duration, IEV:113-01-13}}, but, ideally, all the cycles are identical,
    any variations being constrained within specified limits.
