data:
  definition: the voltage, at a specified point in a channel or telephone set, which
    is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the effective voltages
    of the spectral components of a disturbance induced in the channel or set, each
    voltage being weighted to take account of the corresponding frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For telephony, the conventional weighting is given in the CCITT Recommendation
    0.41 from the Fascicle IV-4 of the Blue Book, 1989.
