    original: IEC 62047-1:2016, 2.5.34, modified â€“ In the definition, "chemisorbed"
      has been replaced by "adsorbed by chemical bonding", and Note 2 to entry has
      been added.

      modification: In the definition, "chemisorbed" has been replaced by "adsorbed
        by chemical bonding", and Note 2 to entry has been added.
      type: modified
  definition: self-organized monolayer of molecules that are adsorbed by chemical
    bonding on a surface due to the specific affinity of the molecule
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a self-assembled monolayer, molecules are typically bonded to the {{substrate,
    IEV:521-05-28}} strongly with chemical bonding while molecules in Langmuir-Blodgett
    films are bonded weakly with physisorption, such as electrostatic force.
  - This note applies to the French language only.
