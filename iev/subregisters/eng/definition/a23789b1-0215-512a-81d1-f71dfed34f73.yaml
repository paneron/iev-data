data:
  definition: that value numerically equal to the lowest modulation frequency at which
    the magnitude of the baseband transfer function of an optical fibre decreases
    to a specified fraction, generally to one half, of the zero frequency value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The bandwidth is limited by several mechanisms : (a) in multimode fibres - mainly
    modal distortion and material dispersion, (b) in singlemode fibres - mainly material
    and waveguide dispersion.'
