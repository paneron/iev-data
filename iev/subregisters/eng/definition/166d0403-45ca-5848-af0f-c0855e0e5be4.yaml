  definition: the ratio of the magnitude of the phase velocity vector of a sinusoidal
    wave in a given direction to the frequency of the wave
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The wavelength has its minimum value in the direction of propagation; if no direction
    is specified. the wavelength is that in the direction of propagation.
  - The wavelength in any direction is 2stem:[Ï€] divided by the absolute value of
    the component, in this direction, of the real part of the wave vector.
