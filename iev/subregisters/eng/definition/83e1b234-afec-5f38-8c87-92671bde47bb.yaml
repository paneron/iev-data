data:
  definition: device predominantly using scattering to alter the spatial distribution
    of radiation from a <a href="IEV845-21-032">source</a>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If all the radiation reflected or transmitted by the diffuser is scattered with
    no regular reflection or regular transmission, the diffuser is said to be completely
    diffusing, independent of whether or not the reflection or transmission is isotropic.
  - Besides scattering, a diffuser can also have a slight reflection and absorption
    effect.
  - This entry was numbered 845-10-34 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
