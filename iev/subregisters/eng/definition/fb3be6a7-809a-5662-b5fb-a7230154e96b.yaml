  definition: at a point of a surface, scalar quantity equal to the limit of the quotient
    of the magnitude of the component vector normal to the surface of the force acting
    at this point, by the area of a surface containing the point, when all the dimensions
    of that surface tend to zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The surface may be the outside surface of a body or a plane surface of a given
    orientation inside the body.
  - 2 Within most fluids, the pressure does not depend on the surface orientation.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of pressure is pascal, Pa. A non-SI unit used by special
    interest groups is bar, symbol bar (1 bar:= 10^5^ Pa = 100 kPa), often combined
    with SI prefixes.
