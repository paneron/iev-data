  definition: 'scalar quantity equal to the line integral of the electric field strength
    stem:[*E*] along a specific path linking two points a and b:


    stem:[U_((ab)) = int_((r_a))^((r_b)) E * d r]


    where stem:[*r*]~a~ and stem:[*r*]~b~ are the position vectors for a and b, respectively,
    and dstem:[*r*] is the vector line element'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the case of an irrotational field strength, the voltage is independent of
    the path and equal to the negative of the electric potential difference between
    the two points:


    stem:[U_((ab)) = - ( V_b - V_a )]'
  - The name "voltage", commonly used in the English language, is an exception from
    the principle that a quantity name should not refer to any name of unit.
