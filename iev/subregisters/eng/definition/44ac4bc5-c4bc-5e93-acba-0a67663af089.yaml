  definition: 'the fractional change of effective permeability due to a change in
    temperature divided by that change in temperature:


    stem:[alpha_((mu e)) = (((( mu_e ))_(theta) - (( mu_e ))_((ref))))/(((( mu_e ))_((ref))
    ( theta - theta_((ref)) )))]


    where (stem:[µ]~e~)stem:[θ] and (stem:[µ]~e~)~ref~ are the effective permeabilities
    at temperatures stem:[θ] and stem:[θ]~ref~ respectively'
