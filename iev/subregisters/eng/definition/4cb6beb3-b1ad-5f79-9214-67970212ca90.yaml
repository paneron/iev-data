  definition: a square array of complex numbers consisting of the amplitude transmission
    factors and the amplitude reflection factors at the ports of a multiport structure
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The scattering matrix is the array of the coefficients of the linear equations
    which express the normalized complex wave amplitudes of the transmitted wave and
    the reflected wave at each port 1, 2, i, ... stem:[n] considered as an output
    port in terms of the normalized complex wave amplitudes of the incident waves
    to the ports 1, 2, j, ... stem:[n] considered as input ports.
