data:
  definition: element of a function chart allowing the transit from a preceding step
    to the following step where the transition depends on a transition condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A transition is enabled if all the immediately preceding steps, connected to this
    transition by directed links, are active.
  - A transition becomes effective, if its transition condition becomes true and the
    transition is cleared by this; the transition activates the following and deactivates
    the preceding step (see Figure 23).
  - One single transition can link one or several preceding steps to one or several
    following steps.
  - This entry was numbered 351-29-24 in IEC 60050-351:2006.
