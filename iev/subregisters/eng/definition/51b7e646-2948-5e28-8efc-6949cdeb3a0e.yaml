data:
  definition: difference in pressure across the {{electrolyte, IEV:485-03-01}} as
    measured from one {{electrode, IEV:485-02-01}} chamber to the other electrode
    chamber
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The differential cell pressure is expressed in Pa.
  - ISO recommends using absolute pressure. If gauge pressure is used, it should be
    so noted.
