  definition: a plane diagram in which the distances measured along specified axes
    represent the trichromatic coordinates of a colour, other than luminance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Two orthogonal axes are normally used, in particular in the case of xy chromaticity
    diagrams, or in the uniform uv chromaticity diagram of the Commission Internationale
    de l'Ã‰clairage.
  - In a chromaticity diagram the real colours occupy a surface area limited on the
    one side by the curve joining those points representing the monochromatic colours
    and on the other by the straight line joining the ends of this curve, the so-called
    purple boundary.
