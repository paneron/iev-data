  definition: for a given kind of particle, that particle for which each characteristic
    that can assume two values has the complementary value, while the remaining characteristics
    are the same
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The concept of antiparticle applies to both elementary particles, e.g. positron
    as antiparticle of electron, and compound particles, such as proton, neutron and
    atom.
  - 2 A particle and its antiparticle have in particular the same rest mass, the same
    spin quantum number, and opposite electric charges. Particle and antiparticle
    may be identical, for example photons.
  - 3 A particle and its antiparticle may interact, resulting in two photons. This
    process is usually called annihilation.
  - 4 An antiparticle is generally denoted by the same symbol as the corresponding
    particle but overlined, and its name is generally the name of the particle with
    the prefix anti, e.g. antiproton stem:[bar p] corresponding to proton p, antihydrogen
    atom corresponding to hydrogen atom.
