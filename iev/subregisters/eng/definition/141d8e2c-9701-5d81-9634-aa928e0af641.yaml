  definition: for an alternating electric current in a conductor, phenomenon in which
    the current density is greater near the surface than in the interior of the conductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The skin effect increases the resistance and decreases the inductance of a conductor
    with the frequency of the electric current.
  - The skin effect occurs also in the more general case of any time-varying current.
