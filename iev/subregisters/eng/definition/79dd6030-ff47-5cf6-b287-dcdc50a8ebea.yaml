  notes:
  - 1 An atomic nucleus is composed of one or more protons and a number of neutrons
    (except hydrogen H), having thus a positive electric charge and nearly all the
    mass of the atom.
  - 2 The mass of the atomic nucleus is smaller than the sum of its constituents,
    due to energy binding them together.
