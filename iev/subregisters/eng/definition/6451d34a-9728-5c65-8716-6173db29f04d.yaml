  definition: a protection whose operation and section selectivity are dependent on
    the measurement of electrical quantities at one end of the protected section by
    the measuring relays and, in some cases, on the exchange of logic signals between
    the ends
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The section selectivity of non-unit protection may depend upon its setting, particularly
    with regard to time.
