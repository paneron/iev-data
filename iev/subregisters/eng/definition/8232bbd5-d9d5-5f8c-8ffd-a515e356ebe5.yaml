  definition: 'relation between the <a href="IEV845-21-080">radiant exitance</a>,
    stem:[M]~e~, of a Planckian radiator and its temperature, stem:[T], given by


    stem:[M]~e~ = stem:[σ] stem:[T]^4^


    where stem:[σ] is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and stem:[T] is the thermodynamic
    temperature'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Stefan-Boltzmann constant can be calculated by stem:[sigma = ((2 pi^5 k^4))/((15
    h^3 c_0^2))] where stem:[h] is the Planck constant, stem:[c]~0~ is the {{speed
    of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}, and stem:[k] is the Boltzmann constant.
  - For the value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, stem:[σ,] see CODATA.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-07 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
