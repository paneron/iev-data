  notes:
  - For a circuit-breaker, this may be a closing operation or an opening operation.
  - If distinction is necessary, an operation in the electrical sense, e.g. make or
    break, is referred to as a switching operation, and an operation in the mechanical
    sense, e.g. close or open, is referred to as a mechanical operation.
