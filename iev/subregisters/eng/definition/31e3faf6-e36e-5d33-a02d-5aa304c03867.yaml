  definition: form of {{transmission, IEV:701-01-03}} in which the transmitted {{signal,
    IEV:101-12-02}} is the result of the {{modulation, IEV:701-03-08}} of one or more
    {{carriers, IEV:702-06-03}} by one or more signals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "carrier transmission" is usually qualified by the method of modulation,
    e.g. “{{single sideband, IEV:702-06-26}} carrier transmission”.
  - A transmission system using carrier transmission is known as a “carrier system”.
