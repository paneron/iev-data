  definition: for a single radioactive decay process, the time stem:[( T_(((1)/(2)))
    )] in which the activity of the radionuclide is reduced to half of its initial
    value by that process
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The radioactive half-life is related to the decay constant by:


    stem:[T_(((1)/(2))) = ((ln 2))/(lambda) ≃ ((0,693))/(lambda)]


    stem:[λ] = decay constant'
