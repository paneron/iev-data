data:
  definition: range between the maximum illuminance level in which contrast appears,
    and the illuminance level corresponding to the minimum signal level limited by
    the noise level in the luminance channel
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The contrast range is obtained from the sum of the luminance compression ratio
    in decibels and the signal-to-noise ratio in decibels of the luminance signal.
