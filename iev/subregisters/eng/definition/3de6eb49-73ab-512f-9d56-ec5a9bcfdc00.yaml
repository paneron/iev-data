  definition: 'at each point of a given space region, scalar stem:[φ] the negative
    of the gradient of which is the vector *stem:[U]* of a given field


    *stem:[U]* = −*grad* stem:[φ]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The vector field *stem:[U]* is a {{conservative field, IEV:102-05-34}} and is
    said to be derived from the scalar field stem:[φ].
  - The scalar potential is not unique since any constant scalar can be added to a
    given scalar potential without changing its gradient.
  - Examples of potential are the {{electric potential, IEV:121-11-25}} and the potential
    in mechanics (see {{IEV 113-03-19, IEV:113-03-19}}).
  - The term "scalar potential" is only used in place of the term "potential" to distinguish
    it from the term "vector potential".
