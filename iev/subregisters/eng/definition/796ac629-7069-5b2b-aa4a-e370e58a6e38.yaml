data:
  definition: a technique for characterizing an optical fibre whereby an optical pulse
    is transmitted through the optical fibre and the optical power of the resulting
    light scattered and reflected back to the input is measured as a function of time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Useful in estimating attenuation coefficient for uniform fibres, and identifying
    and localising defects and localised losses.
