  definition: mean value of illuminance on the outer curved surface of a very small
    (real or imaginary) cylinder that is oriented vertically at a point in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Cylindrical illuminance is sometimes also defined as the arithmetic mean of the
    vertical illuminance stem:[E]~v,v~ at a point


    stem:[E_((v ,c)) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_0^((2 pi)) E_((v ,v)) d phi]


    where stem:[E]~v,v~ is the vertical illuminance for an area element with its normal
    in the direction stem:[φ], and stem:[φ] is the angle in the plane perpendicular
    to the axis of the cylinder.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "cylindrical irradiance". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon cylindrical irradiance".
  - The cylindrical illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
