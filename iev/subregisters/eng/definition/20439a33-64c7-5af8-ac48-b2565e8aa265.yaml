  definition: 'a figure of merit often used to characterize optical detector performance
    defined by the formula:


    stem:[D^( ** ) = D sqrt(A * Delta f)]


    where stem:[D] is the detectivity, stem:[A] the area of the photosensitive region
    of the detector and Î”stem:[f] the effective noise bandwidth'
