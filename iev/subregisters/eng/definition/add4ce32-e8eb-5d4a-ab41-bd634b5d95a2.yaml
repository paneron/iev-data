  definition: frequency of radiation received by a radio receiver and which may produce
    an interference of the wanted signal by intermodulation with the local oscillation
    when one intermodulation product has a frequency nearly equal to the intermediate
    frequency of the receiver
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Possible spurious frequencies are mainly the sub-multiples of combination frequencies
    between the local oscillator frequency and the intermediate frequency, and sub-multiples
    of the tuned frequency.
