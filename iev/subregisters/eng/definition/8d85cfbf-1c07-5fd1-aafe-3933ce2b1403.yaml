data:
  definition: quotient of the flux, stem:[Φ]~i~, indirectly reaching a surface in
    a cavity, and the primary flux, stem:[Φ]~o~, directly received by another surface,
    the flux stem:[Φ]~i~ resulting from the interreflection undergone by the flux
    stem:[Φ]~o~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The interreflection ratio has unit one.
