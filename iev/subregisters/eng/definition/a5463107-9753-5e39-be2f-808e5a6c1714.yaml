  definition: conductive plate separating individual cells in a fuel cell stack, acting
    as {{current collector, IEV:485-06-07}} and providing mechanical support for the
    {{electrodes, IEV:485-02-01}} or {{membrane electrode assembly, IEV:485-04-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bipolar plate usually incorporates flow fields on either side for the distribution
    of reactants (fuel and oxidant) and removal of products, and can also contain
    conduits for heat transfer. The bipolar plate provides a physical barrier to avoid
    the mixing of oxidant, fuel and coolant fluids.
