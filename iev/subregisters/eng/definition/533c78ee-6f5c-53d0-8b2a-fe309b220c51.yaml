  definition: inability to meet the load, due to a generation capacity shortfall or
    other reasons
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Generation capacity shortfall can result from {{forced outage, IEV:692-04-05}}
    of a generating unit, or demand exceeding designed capacity.
  - Definition {{IEV 603-04-43, IEV:603-04-43}} "sudden reduction of the power demand"
    is inconsistent with this and related terms, e.g. loss of load probability.
