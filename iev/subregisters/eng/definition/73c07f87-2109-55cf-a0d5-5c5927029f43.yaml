  definition: 'vector *rot* stem:[*U*] associated at each point of a given space region
    with a vector *stem:[U]*, equal to the limit of the integral over a closed surface
    S of the vector product of the vector surface element and the vector *stem:[U]*,
    divided by the volume of the interior of the surface, when the surface is contained
    in a sphere the radius of which tends to zero


    stem:[rot U = underset((V -&gt; 0))((lim)) (1)/(V) underset(S)( âˆ¯ ) e_n xx U d
    A]


    where *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface element oriented outwards and
    stem:[V] is the volume'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the three coordinates of the rotation are:


    stem:[((del U_z))/((del y)) - ((del U_y))/((del z)) , ((del U_x))/((del z)) -
    ((del U_z))/((del x)) , ((del U_y))/((del x)) - ((del U_x))/((del y))]'
  - The rotation of a polar vector is an axial vector and the rotation of an axial
    vector is a polar vector.
  - The rotation of the vector field *stem:[U]* is denoted by stem:[rot U] or stem:[grad
    xx U]. In some English texts, the rotation is denoted by stem:[curl U].
