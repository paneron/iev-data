  definition: Type of Protection in which the parts capable of igniting an explosive
    gas atmosphere are fixed in position and completely surrounded by filling material
    to prevent the ignition of an external explosive gas atmosphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This Type of Protection cannot prevent the surrounding explosive gas atmosphere
    from penetrating into the equipment and components and being ignited by the circuits.
    However, due to the small free volumes in the filling material and due to the
    quenching of a flame that can propagate through the paths in the filling material,
    an external explosion is prevented.
