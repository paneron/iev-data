data:
  definition: angle of observation at which the luminance has half the value of the
    luminance of the diffused light at the angle of 0°, with perpendicular incidence
    of the light
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For indicating the shape of the scattering indicatrix it is recommended that the
    diffusion factor, stem:[σ], be used for strongly diffusing materials, and the
    half-value angle, stem:[γ], for poorly diffusing materials.
  - The half-value angle is expressed in radian (rad) or degree (°).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-90 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
