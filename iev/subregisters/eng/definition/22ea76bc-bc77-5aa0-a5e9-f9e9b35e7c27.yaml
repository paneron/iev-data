data:
  definition: the coupling loss of optical power, intrinsic to the fibre, caused by
    fibre parameter mismatches when two non-identical fibres are joined
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Typical fibre parameters giving rise to intrinsic joint loss are geometric properties,
    difference in index profiles etc.
