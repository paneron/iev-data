  definition: 'ratio between the time period (stem:[t]~1~), in which the output voltage
    is above a specified level, and the time period (stem:[t]~2~), in which the output
    voltage is below the specified level

  notes:
  - The symmetry is expressed in percent of the duration of the full signal period.
  - 'The specified level may be the arithmetic mean between levels stem:[V]~OL~ and
    stem:[V]~OH~, or 50 % of the peak-to-peak amplitude. The ratio is expressed as:


    stem:[((100 t_1))/((t_1 + t_2)) : ((100 t_2))/((t_1 + t_2))]'
