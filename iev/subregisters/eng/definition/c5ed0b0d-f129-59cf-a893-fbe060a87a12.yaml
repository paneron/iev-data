  definition: 'pertaining to an operating characteristic, a device, an electrical
    network or a transmission medium satisfying the superposition principle according
    to which, within a specified working range:


    - at a specified output port, the signal resulting from an arbitrary input signal
    applied to a given port is such that, when the input signal is increased by a
    numerical factor, the output signal is also increased by the same factor.


    - at a specified output port, the total signal resulting from the simultaneous
    application of a number of arbitrary input signals, either individually to given
    independent ports or collectively into one given port, is the sum of individual
    outputs which would be produced by the application to the same input ports of
    the same input signals, each acting separately'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A device with several ports may be linear only for a certain set of ports.
