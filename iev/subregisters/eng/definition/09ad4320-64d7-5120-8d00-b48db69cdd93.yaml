  definition: quotient of the luminance of a field and the illuminance on the plane
    of that field, for a <a href="IEV845-29-020">diffused lighting</a> and an observation
    direction forming a {{grazing angle, IEV:705-04-04}} with the road surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The luminance coefficient in diffuse illumination is expressed in candela per
    square metre per lux (cd·m^−2^·lx^−1^).
