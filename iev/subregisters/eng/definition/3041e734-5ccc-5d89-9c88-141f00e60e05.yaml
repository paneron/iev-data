data:
  definition: semiconductor in which the Fermi level is situated in the conduction
    band, or in the valence band or is closer than twice the product of Boltzmann's
    constant and the thermodynamic temperature to either band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The charge carriers of a degenerate semiconductor are governed by Fermi-Dirac
    statistics.
