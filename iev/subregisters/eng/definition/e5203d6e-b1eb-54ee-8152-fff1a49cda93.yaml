  definition: under sinusoidal conditions, circuit-theory theorem stating that the
    electric current in a passive linear two-terminal network connected to any two
    terminals of a linear network is equal to the voltage between the two terminals
    before the connection divided by the sum of the impedance of the two-terminal
    network and the impedance of the network seen from the two terminals before the
    connection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Thevenin theorem can be generalized to non-sinusoidal conditions.
