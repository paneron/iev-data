  definition: 'a method of justification in which the digit time-slots used to convey
    a digital signal have a digit rate that is always lower than the digit rate of
    the original signal, and in which at each justification instant, depending on
    the prevailing conditions, either:


    a) one digit of the original signal is transmitted in the justifiable digit time-slot,
    or


    b) two digits of the original signal are transmitted, one in the justifiable digit
    time-slot with the other digit being removed and then transmitted by another means,


    with these alternative justification states being indicated by unique signals
    formed from justification service digits'
