  definition: geometric area of the {{electrode, IEV:485-02-01}} perpendicular to
    the direction of the current flow
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The active area is expressed in m^2^.
  - The active area, also called effective area, is used in the calculation of the
    cell {{current density, IEV:485-12-01}}.
