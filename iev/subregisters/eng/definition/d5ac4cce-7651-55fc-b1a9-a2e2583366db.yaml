  definition: in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, ordered set of three linearly
    independent vectors *stem:[U]*, *stem:[V]* and *stem:[W]*, such that for an observer
    looking in the direction of *stem:[W]*, the rotation through the smaller angle
    from *stem:[U]* to *stem:[V]* is observed to be in the anticlockwise sense
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The vectors of a left-handed trihedron are oriented: the thumb (*stem:[U]*),
    the forefinger (*stem:[V]*) and the middle finger (*stem:[W]*) of the left hand,
    when the forefinger (*stem:[V]*) is extended and the latter (*stem:[W]*) is pointing
    at right angles to the others (*stem:[U]*) and (*stem:[V]*).'
