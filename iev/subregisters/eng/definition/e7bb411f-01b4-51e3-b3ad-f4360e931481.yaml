  definition: at a point of a surface, plane, if it exists, which contains all the
    tangents at this point to the curves of the surface passing through the point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a surface defined by stem:[r = f ( u , v )], where stem:[( u , v ) in U sube
    R^2], the tangent plane at point *stem:[r]*(stem:[u]~0~, stem:[v]~0~) is defined
    by the vectors stem:[(( ((del f))/((del u)) ))_([[u = u_0],[v = v_0]])] and stem:[((
    ((del f))/((del v)) ))_(([[u = u_0],[v = v_0]]))] if they are linearly independent.
