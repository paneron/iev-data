  definition: model, applicable for wavelengths negligible in comparison to other
    relevant geometrical dimensions, by which the propagation of waves in various
    media and at their boundaries is determined by using the geometrical concept of
    rays and not the general theory of waves
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “geometric optics” has a historical origin, but the model is used for
    any kind of waves.
