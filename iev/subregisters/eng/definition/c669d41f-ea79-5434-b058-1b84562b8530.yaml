  definition: apparatus used to grow a high quality single crystal semiconductor by
    applying high magnetic field that a superconducting magnet generates for inhibiting
    convection of the molten metal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - MCZ is magnetic-field assisted Czochralski method to grow and pull up a single
    crystal.
  - This technique can also be used for growth of other materials.
