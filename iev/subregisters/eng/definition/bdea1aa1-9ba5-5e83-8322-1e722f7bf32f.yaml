data:
  definition: a curve showing, as a function of the virtual height, the ratio of the
    frequencies of the radio waves which, using a simplified model of the ionosphere,
    would be reflected at the same virtual height at vertical incidence and at oblique
    incidence between two points on the surface of the Earth separated by a given
    distance, usually 3000 km
