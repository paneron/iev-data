  definition: 'quotient of the temperature coefficient of permeability by the permeability
    at temperature stem:[Θ]


    stem:[alpha_F = ((alpha_(mu)))/((mu_(Theta))) = ((mu_(Theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_(Theta)

    or


    stem:[alpha_F = ((alpha_(mu)))/((mu_(ref))) = ((mu_(Theta) - mu_((ref))))/((mu_(ref)^2

    when stem:[µ]~stem:[Θ]~ and stem:[µ]~ref~ differ insignificantly'

  notes:
  - 'The temperature factor of permeability is a material property which enables to
    calculate the temperature coefficient of effective permeability stem:[α]~stem:[µ]e~
    by multiplying stem:[α]~F~ by stem:[µ]~e~:


    stem:[alpha_((mu e)) = alpha_F * mu_((e^( * )))]'
