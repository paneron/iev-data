  definition: ". for a deterministic function, correlation function of the function\
    \ and a time-delayed replica \n.  for a stationary random function, mathematical\
    \ expectation of the product of the function and a time-delayed replica:\n\nstem:[C\

  notes:
  - The autocorrelation function of a deterministic function or a stationary random
    function is the inverse Fourier transform of its power spectral density.
  - 'When a stationary random function can be considered as ergodic, its autocorrelation
    function can be calculated from a particular sample:


    stem:[C ( t ) = underset((T -&gt; oo))((lim)) (1)/((2 T)) int_( - T)^( + T) f
    ( tau ) f ( t + tau ) d tau]'
