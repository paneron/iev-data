data:
  definition: point, line or surface in a standing wave where some specified characteristic
    of the wave field has essentially zero amplitude
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, this amplitude is generally not zero but simply a minimum. The node
    is then said to be partial.
  - The appropriate modifier should be used before the word "node" to signify the
    type that is intended; e.g. displacement node, particle velocity node, sound pressure
    node.
