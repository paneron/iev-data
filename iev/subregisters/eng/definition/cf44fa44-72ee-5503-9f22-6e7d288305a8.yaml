  definition: irradiation or measurement of reflecting materials at 8° to the normal,
    at one azimuth angle
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Eight-degree geometry is used to substitute the 0° directional geometry in many
    practical applications of reflection measurements, as it permits differentiation
    between specular-component-included and specular-component-excluded measurements.
  - This geometry is restricted to measurements using an integrating sphere as described
    in CIE 15, stem:[Colorimetry].
