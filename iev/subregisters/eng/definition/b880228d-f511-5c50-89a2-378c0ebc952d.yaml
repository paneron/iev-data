  definition: for a uniformly magnetized body, the ratio of the self-demagnetizing
    field strength to the magnetization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the magnetization is not uniform, an average value may be assigned to the demagnetization
    factor provided the conditions are stated.
  - In permanent magnet technology, a demagnetization factor is sometimes used to
    represent the slope of the load line.
