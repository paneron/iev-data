  notes:
  - Since the development of photostrictive materials, various light-driven actuators
    have been proposed. These actuators have simple structures and can be driven by
    wireless means. A motor is proposed that utilizes the spin realignment effect,
    in which a magnetic material absorbs light and the resulting heat changes the
    direction of magnetization reversibly. Actuators utilizing thermal expansion,
    and exploiting polymer photochemical reactions, are also being studied.
