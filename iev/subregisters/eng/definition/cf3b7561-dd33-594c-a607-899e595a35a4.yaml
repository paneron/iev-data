  definition: 'the value of a signal element of a uniform multivalue digital signal,
    with the unit of value being so chosen that adjacent values differ by one unit
    according to the following rules:


    a) for all unbalanced signals, the lowest notional value is zero;


    b) for balanced signals having an even number of permitted discrete values, the
    notional values are symmetrical about, but omit zero;


    c) for balanced signals having an odd number of permitted discrete values, the
    notional values are symmetrical about, and include zero'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Examples of the notional values of uniform multivalue digital signals are as
    follows:
