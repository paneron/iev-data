data:
  definition: level in decibels equal to ten times the logarithm to the base ten of
    the ratio of the backscattering cross-section of the object to the spherical reference
    area of stem:[4 pi r_0^2] where stem:[r]~0~ is the reference distance, preferably
    chosen to be 1 m
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Whatever the reference area used, it shall be specified.
  - The object scattering differential for a designated direction other than backward
    is similarly defined.
  - Otherwise described, the object backscattering differential is the backscattered
    sound pressure level that would exist at the reference distance of stem:[r]~0~
    from the acoustic centre of the scattering object, minus the sound pressure level
    of a plane wave incident on the object.
  - 'Expressed in letter symbols, the definition reads:


    stem:[N_((ts)) = L_((SC)) - L_i = 10 (log)_((10)) ((A_((ob))))/((4 pi r_0^2))
    dB]


    where:


    stem:[N]~ts~ is object backscattering differential or target strength


    stem:[L]~SC~ is backscattered sound pressure level at reference distance


    stem:[L]~i~ is incident sound pressure level


    stem:[A]~ob~ is backscattering cross-section of object


    stem:[r]~0~ is reference distance


    stem:[4 pi r_0^2] is reference area for object backscattering differential.'
