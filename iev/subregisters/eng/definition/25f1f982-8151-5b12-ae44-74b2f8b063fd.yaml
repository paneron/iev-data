  definition: 'quotient of blue light hazard weighted radiant flux and radiant flux


    stem:[eta_B = ((int Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) B ( lambda ) d lambda))/((int
    Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) d lambda))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The blue light hazard efficiency of radiation, stem:[η]~B~, is related to the
    blue light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation, stem:[K]~B,v~, through stem:[η]~B~ =
    stem:[K·K]~B,v~, where stem:[K] is luminous efficacy of radiation, and to the
    blue light hazard factor of luminous radiation, stem:[α]~B,v~, through stem:[η]~B~ =
    stem:[V·α]~B,v~, where stem:[V] is luminous efficiency of radiation.
  - For some applications it might be necessary to state both blue light hazard efficiency
    of radiation, stem:[η]~B~, and blue light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation,
    stem:[K]~B,v~.
  - The blue light hazard efficiency of radiation has unit one.
