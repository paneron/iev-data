  definition: 'for a two-terminal element or a two-terminal circuit under periodic
    conditions, quantity equal to the square root of the difference of the squares
    of the apparent power stem:[S] and the active power stem:[P]


    stem:[Q_( ∼ ) = sqrt(S^2 - P^2)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Under sinusoidal conditions, the non-active power is the absolute value of the
    reactive power stem:[Q] or the imaginary part of the complex power stem:[underset(_)(S)],
    thus stem:[Q_( ∼ ) = | Q | = | Im underset(_)(S) |].
  - The coherent SI unit for non-active power is voltampere, VA. The special name
    "var" and its symbol "var" are also used. See {{131-11-45, IEV:131-11-45}}.
