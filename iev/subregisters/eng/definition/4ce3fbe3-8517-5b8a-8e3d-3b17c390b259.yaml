  definition: 'for a gamma or X-ray emitting nuclide, the quotient of stem:[l^2 ((
    ((d X))/((d t)) ))_(delta)] by stem:[A], where (dstem:[Х]/dstem:[t])~stem:[δ]~
    is the exposure rate due to photons of energy greater than stem:[δ] at a distance
    stem:[I] from a point source of this nuclide having an activity stem:[A]


    stem:[Gamma_(delta) = ((l^2))/(A) (( ((d X))/((d t)) ))_(delta)]


    A special unit of exposure rate constant is Rm^2^h^−1^Ci^−1^.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It is assumed that the attenuation in the source and along stem:[I] is negligible.
    In the case of radium, the value of stem:[Γ] is determined for a filter thickness
    of 0,5 mm platinum. Moreover, stem:[Γ] is related not to the activity but to the
    mass of ^226^Ra; a special unit is then Rm^2^h^−1^g^−1^.
