  definition: the plane containing the centre of mass of the primary body and the
    velocity vector of a satellite, the frame of reference being that specified for
    defining the orbital elements
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of an unperturbed orbit, the orbital plane is fixed in a frame of
    reference whose centre is the centre of mass of the primary body and whose axes
    have fixed directions in relation to the stars.
