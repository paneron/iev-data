  definition: the transfer time for the case in which the primary signal to the telecontrol
    transmitter is input at the most unfavourable moment with respect to the telecontrol
    system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The maximum transfer time may occur within a cyclic system if information is input
    just after scanning the corresponding input element or within a quiescent system
    if information is input just after the start of transmission of another signal
    block.
