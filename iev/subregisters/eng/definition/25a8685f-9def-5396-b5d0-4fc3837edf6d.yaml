  definition: alternating velocity which would be imparted to a stylus tip of negligible
    dimensions, fitted to a pick-up head having no mechanical impedance when tracing
    the groove of a record rotating with a constant angular velocity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The recorded velocity is represented by a vector with a lateral and a vertical
    component for records with stereophonic recording.
  - The recorded velocity may be measured by the Buchmann and Meyer method. It should
    always be stated whether r.m.s. or peak values are implied.
