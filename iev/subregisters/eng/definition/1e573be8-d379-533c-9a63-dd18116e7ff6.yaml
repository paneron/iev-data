  definition: '1 - state of a ferromagnetic material subjected to an external magnetic
    field of such intensity that the induced magnetization cannot be substantially
    increased by further strengthening of that magnetic field


    2 - (Deprecated in this sense.) state of remanent magnetization which results
    from having subjected a ferromagnetic material to such an external magnetic field.
    It is more accurately called "saturation remanence"'
