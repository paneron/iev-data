data:
  definition: plane in which the surface of a sample or standard is placed during
    measurements
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For reflection measurements, the geometry is defined with respect to the reference
    plane. For transmission measurements, there is a reference plane for the incident
    light and a second reference plane, displaced by the sample thickness, for the
    transmitted light.
