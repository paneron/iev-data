  definition: a form of free electromagnetic oscillation in a cavity resonator characterized
    by a particular field configuration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a waveguide cavity, a mode of resonance having no axial component of the electric
    or magnetic field is classified as a TE mode or a лблю mode respectively; the corresponding
    transverse field pattern resembles that of a normal mode in the corresponding
    uniform waveguide.
