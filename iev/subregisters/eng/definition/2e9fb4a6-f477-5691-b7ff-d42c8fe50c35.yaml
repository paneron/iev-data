  definition: beam of optical radiation whose electric field amplitude distribution
    is Gaussian when measured across a cross-section
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When such a beam is circular in cross-section, the amplitude is:


    stem:[Е(r)] = stem:[E] (0) exp [– (stem:[r] / stem:[w])^2^]


    where stem:[r] is the distance from beam centre and stem:[w] is the radius at
    which the amplitude is 1/e of its value on the axis.'
