  definition: test of the {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}}'s performance based on that
    of a {{single cell, IEV:485-05-02}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The single cell test is typically a laboratory scale test in which several variables
    can be adjusted in order to obtain data over a wide range of conditions, such
    as temperature, {{current density, IEV:485-12-01}}, fuel and oxidant flow rates,
    etc. The outcome of a single cell test can be a {{polarization curve, IEV:485-15-06}},
    a voltage stability plot, or other data related to fuel cell performance.
