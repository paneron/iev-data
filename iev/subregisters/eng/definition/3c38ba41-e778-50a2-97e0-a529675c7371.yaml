  definition: value of the electric current in a connector used for specification
    purposes, established for the operating condition in which the electric current
    is present continuously and simultaneously in all contacts of the connector being
    wired with the largest specified conductor, while the ambient temperature near
    the connector is maintained at 40 Â°C
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If other ambient temperatures are used for the definition of rated connector current,
    the specification should state in the ambient temperature on which the rating
    is based, with reference, if appropriate, to the rating curve defined in IEC 60512,
    test 5b.
