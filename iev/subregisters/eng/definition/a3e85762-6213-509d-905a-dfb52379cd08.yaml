  definition: ratio of the power of the {{wanted signal, IEV:702-08-01}} to the total
    power of {{interfering signals, IEV:161-01-04}} and {{noise, IEV:702-08-03}},
    evaluated under specified conditions at a specified point of a {{transmission
    channel, IEV:701-02-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "The signal-to-interference ratio\r\nis generally expressed in {{decibels, IEV:702-07-02}}."
  - "The specified conditions comprise among others:\r\n \r\n* the nature and characteristics\
    \ of the wanted signal, \r\n* the nature and characteristics of the interfering\
    \ signals and the noise,\r\n* the characteristics of the receiver, such as the\
    \ {{bandwidth, IEV:161-06-09}}.\r\n"
