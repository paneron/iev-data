  definition: 'a method of justification in which the digit time-slots used to convey
    a digital signal have a digit rate that, at various times, may be higher than,
    the same as, or lower than the digit rate of the original signal, and in which
    at each justification instant, depending on the prevailing conditions, either:


    a) no digit of the original signal is transmitted but, instead, a justifying digit
    is transmitted in the justifiable digit time-slot, or


    b) one digit of the original signal is transmitted in the justifiable digit time-slot,
    or


    c) two digits of the original signal are transmitted, one in the justifiable digit
    time-slot with the other digit being removed and then transmitted by another means,


    with these three alternative justification states being indicated by unique signals
    formed from justification service digits'
