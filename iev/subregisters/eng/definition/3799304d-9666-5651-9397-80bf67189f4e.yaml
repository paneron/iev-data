  definition: electric stimulus originating from a current flowing through the human
    body between electrodes whose polarities change once during the application of
    current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Bipolar stimuli are generally balanced in such a way that no electric charge resulting
    from the current applied for the electric stimulus remains in the human body at
    the end of the time interval during which the current is applied.
