data:
  definition: process in which a {{signal, IEV:701-01-02}} is sampled and the difference
    between each {{sample, IEV:702-04-06}} and its predicted value derived from the
    succession of previous samples or quantized values is {{quantized, IEV:351-41-13}},
    and the resulting succession of quantized values is converted by {{encoding, IEV:702-05-13}}
    into a {{digital signal, IEV:702-04-05}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Differential pulse code modulation is an example of {{differential coding, IEV:723-10-47}}.
