  definition: logarithm of the ratio of a given time-mean-square standard-frequency-weighted
    sound pressure for a stated time period, to the square of the reference sound
    pressure of 20 Î¼Pa. Time-average sound level in decibels is ten times the logarithm
    to the base ten of that ratio
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If a frequency weighting is not specified, the A-frequency weighting is understood.
  - In principle, exponential time weighting is not involved.
