data:
  definition: oscillation in which every cycle consists of two or more aperiodic processes,
    each process being switched to another one when a characteristic quantity associated
    with this process reaches a certain value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A typical example of a relaxation oscillation is the oscillation occurring when
    a capacitor is charged by a current source and discharged through a voltage controlled
    switch. Every cycle consists of charging followed by simultaneous charging and
    discharging.
