  definition: angle between a defined datum axis on the luminaire and the horizontal
    when the luminaire is mounted for field use
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The defined datum axis can be any feature of the luminaire but it will usually
    relate to a feature that is nominally aligned with the horizontal such as an axis
    through the luminous opening or an axis through an array of LEDs or a fixing spigot
    entry axis.
  - The tilt in application is the actual tilt of the luminaire when it is mounted
    for field use and should not be confused with "tilt normal in application" or
    "designed attitude" (see CIE 121, _The Photometry and Goniophotometry of Luminaires_).
  - The tilt in application is expressed in radian (rad) or degree (Â°).
