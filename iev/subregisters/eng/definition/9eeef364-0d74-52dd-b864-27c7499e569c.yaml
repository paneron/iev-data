  definition: 'a complex vector stem:[vec underset(_)(K) = vec K^( '' ) + j vec K^(
    ″ )] which characterizes a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave relative to a point
    in space when each of the electromagnetic field vectors can be represented, in
    a domain of space in the neighbourhood of this point, by an expression such as:


    stem:[vec (underset(_)(V))_i = vec underset(_)(V)_((oi)) e^(j ( omega t - vec
    underset(_)(K) * vec r ))]


    in which:


    - vectors stem:[vec underset(_)(V)_((oi))], generally complex, are independent
    of time and practically constant in the domain considered,


    - stem:[vec underset(_)(K)] vector is practically constant in the domain considered,


    - stem:[ω] is the angular frequency,


    - stem:[t] is time,


    - stem:[vec r] is the vector joining the origin of coordinates to the point of
    interest in the domain'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the wave can be characterized by a wave vector at every point in a domain,
    there exists a wavefront containing the point and orthogonal to the real part
    stem:[vec K^( ' )] of the wave vector. The magnitude of stem:[vec underset(_)(K)]
    is 2π divided by the wavelength.
  - The wave has an elliptical polarization if the imaginary part of each vector stem:[vec
    underset(_)(V)_((oi))] is neither zero nor collinear with its real part; the wave
    has a linear polarization in the other cases.
