  definition: potential ignition source that is able to ignite an explosive atmosphere
    when consideration is taken of when it occurs (i.e. in normal operation, expected
    malfunction or rare malfunction)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This is important for establishing the EPL.
  - An effective ignition source is a potential ignition source which can ignite the
    explosive atmosphere if protective measures are not used.
  - For example, the frictional heat that can be produced by a bearing is a possible
    ignition source. This is an equipment-related ignition source if the piece of
    equipment contains a bearing. If the energy that can be produced by the friction
    in the bearing is capable of igniting an explosive atmosphere, then this is a
    potential ignition source. Whether this potential ignition source is effective
    depends on the likelihood that it will occur in a particular situation.
