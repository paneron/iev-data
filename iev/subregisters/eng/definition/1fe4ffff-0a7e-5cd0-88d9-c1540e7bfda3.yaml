  definition: set of values attributed to a measurand
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This term is used in the "uncertainty" approach.
  - The central value of the whole can be selected as value of the measurand and a
    parameter caracterising the dispersion as uncertainty.
  - The result of a measurement is related to the indication given by the instrument
    and to the values of correction obtained by calibration and by the use of a model.
  - The set of values can be considered as representing the measurand provided that
    it is compatible with all other measurements of the same measurand.
  - The set, and hence the uncertainty, can only be given with a stated level of confidence.
