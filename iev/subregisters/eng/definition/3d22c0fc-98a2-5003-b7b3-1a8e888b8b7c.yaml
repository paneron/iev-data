  notes:
  - A normative document can be said to be “implemented” in two different ways. It
    may be applied in production, trade, etc., and it may be taken over, wholly or
    in part, in another normative document. Through the medium of this second document,
    it may then be applied, or it may again be taken over in yet another normative
    document.
