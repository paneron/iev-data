  definition: 'the inductance of a coil of specified geometry, placed on a given core
    in a specified position, divided by the square of the number of turns


    stem:[AL] = stem:[L]/stem:[N]^2^


    where stem:[L] is the inductance of the coil when placed on the core and stem:[N]
    is the number of turns on the coil'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 – The inductance factor is closely related to permeance stem:[Λ]; the latter
    refers to the reluctance of a core while inductance factor refers to the core
    with a winding.
  - 2 – In principle inductance factor can correspond to the several forms of permeability
    defined in the IEV, for example amplitude permeability, but unless otherwise specified
    it should be assumed that it corresponds to the effective permeability at vanishingly
    small field strengths.
  - '3 – The concept "turns factor" (stem:[α]) has been used in the past. It was defined
    as : the number of turns that a coil of specified geometry, placed on a given
    core in a specified position, should have to obtain unit inductance (normally
    the millihenry):


    stem:[α] = stem:[N]/stem:[√L]'
