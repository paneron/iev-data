  definition: for a non-linear element with a sinusoidal input variable in steady
    state of the output variable the frequency response obtained by taking only the
    fundamental component of the output variable
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The describing function may depend on the angular frequency and on the amplitude
    of the input variable, or only on the amplitude of the input variable.
