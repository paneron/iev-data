  definition: number and reference together expressing magnitude of a {{quantity,
    IEV:112-01-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "According to the type of reference, the value of a quantity is either:\n\n\r\n\
    . a product of a number and a {{unit of measurement, IEV:112-01-14}} (the unit\
    \ one is generally omitted for quantities of dimension one, as in examples f and\
    \ g):\n\na) Length of a given rod: 5,34 m or 534 cm\n\nb) Mass of a given body:\
    \ 0,152 kg  or 152 g\n\nc) Curvature of a given arc: 112 m^–1^, expressed in words\
    \ by \"one hundred and twelve per metre\"\n\nd) Celsius temperature of a given\
    \ sample: –5 °C\n\ne) Electric impedance of a given circuit element at a given\
    \ frequency, where j is the imaginary unit: (7,5 + 3,2 j) Ω\n\nf) Refractive index\
    \ of a given sample of glass: 1,32\n\ng) Mass fraction of cadmium in a given sample\
    \ of copper: 3 µg/kg or  3 × 10^–1^\n\nh) Molality of Pb^2+^ in a given sample\
    \ of water: 1,76 mmol/kg\r\n. a number and a reference to a measurement procedure:\n\
    \nRockwell C hardness of a given sample: 43,5 HCR\r\n. a number and a reference\
    \ material:\n\nArbitrary amount-of-substance concentration of lutropin in a given\
    \ sample of human blood plasma (WHO International Standard 80/552 used as a calibrator):\
    \ 5,0 IU/l, where \"IU\" stands for \"WHO International Unit\"\r\n\n\nIn the first\
    \ case, the value of a quantity stem:[Q] is generally denoted {stem:[Q]}[[stem:[Q]]]\
    \ where {stem:[Q]} is the numerical value and [[stem:[Q]]] is the unit of measurement."
  - The number can be complex (see example e in Note 1 to entry).
  - The value of a quantity can be presented in more than one way (see examples a,
    b, and g in Note 1 to entry).
  - 'In the case of vector or tensor quantities, each component has a value, and the
    same for the magnitude of a vector quantity. Example:


    force acting on a given particle, e.g. in Cartesian components


    (stem:[F]~stem:[x]~; stem:[F]~stem:[y]~; stem:[F]~stem:[z]~) = (–31,5; 43,2; 17,0)
