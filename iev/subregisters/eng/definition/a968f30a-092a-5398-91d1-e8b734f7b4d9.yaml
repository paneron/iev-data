  definition: for any element stem:[a] of a set in which a multiplication with a neutral
    element stem:[u] is defined, the unique element stem:[a^(- 1)] of the set, if
    it exists, such that stem:[a * a^(- 1) = a^(- 1) * a = u]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In English, the term "reciprocal" is preferred for numbers.
  - The inverse of element stem:[a] is denoted by stem:[a^(- 1)]. For a non-zero number,
    or for a quantity or unit, the inverse may also be denoted by stem:[1 // a] or
    stem:[(1)/(a)].
