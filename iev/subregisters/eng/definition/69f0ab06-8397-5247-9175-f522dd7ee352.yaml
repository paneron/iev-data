  definition: energy that emanates from a source in the form of {{electromagnetic
    waves, IEV:121-11-63}} or {{photons, IEV:113-05-14}} and is transferred through
    space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “electromagnetic radiation” is also used for the phenomenon producing
    the electromagnetic waves or photons (see {{IEV 702-02-07, IEV:702-02-07}}).
  - The physical concepts of photons and electromagnetic waves are used to describe
    the same phenomenon of transmission of radiant energy in different ways, depending
    on the nature of the interaction of the energy with the physical world (wave-particle
    dualism).
  - The French term "radiation électromagnétique" applies preferably to a single element
    of any electromagnetic radiation, characterized by one frequency or by one wavelength
    in vacuum.
