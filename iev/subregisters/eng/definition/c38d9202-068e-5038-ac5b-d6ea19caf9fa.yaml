  definition: electrical apparatus that contains both energy-limited and non-energy-limited
    circuits and is constructed so that the non-energy-limited circuits cannot adversely
    affect the energy-limited circuits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Associated energy-limited apparatus is:


    <ol type="a">. additionally protected by an alternative method of protection included
    in IEC 60079-15,_Explosive atmospheres – Part 15: Equipment protection by Type
    of Protection "n"_, for use in the appropriate explosive gas atmosphere &amp;lsqb;nC
    or nR&amp;rsqb;; or. additionally protected by an alternative Type of Protection
    listed in IEC 600790, _Explosive atmospheres – Part 0: Equipment – General requirements_,
    for use in the appropriate explosive gas atmosphere; or. not protected by a Type
    of Protection suitable for use in the appropriate explosive atmosphere and therefore
    is not to be used within an explosive atmosphere, for example, a recorder that
    is not of itself in an explosive gas atmosphere but is connected to a thermocouple
    situated within an explosive gas atmosphere where only the recorder input circuit
    is energy-limited &amp;lsqb;Ex nL&amp;rsqb;'
  - 'Associated energy-limited apparatus "&amp;lsqb;nL&amp;rsqb;" has been replaced
    by "&amp;lsqb;ic&amp;rsqb;" in IEC 60079-11, _Explosive atmospheres – Part 11:
    Equipment protection by intrinsic safety "i"_.'
