    two successive positions at which the phase is the same

  notes:
  - 'The wavelength in a medium is equal to the wavelength in vacuo divided by the
    refractive index of the medium. In photometry, unless otherwise stated, values
    of wavelength are generally those in air. The refractive index of standard air
    (for spectroscopy: stem:[T] = 15 °C, stem:[p] = 101 325 Pa) lies between 1,000 27
    and 1,000 29 for <a href="IEV845-21-003">visible radiation</a>.'
  - In some specific applications, such as fluorescence measurements, the symbol stem:[μ]
    is used for the wavelengths of excitation radiation.
  - stem:[λ] = stem:[v] / stem:[ν], where stem:[λ] is the wavelength in a medium,
    stem:[v] is the phase velocity in that medium and stem:[ν] is the {{frequency,
    IEV:103-06-02}}.
  - The wavelength is expressed in metres (m) or decimal submultiples of metre.
  - In <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>, the units nanometre (nm) and
    micrometre (μm) are generally used.
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-14 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
