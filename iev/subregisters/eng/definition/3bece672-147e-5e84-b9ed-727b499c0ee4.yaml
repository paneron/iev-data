  definition: property of a {{sinusoidal, IEV:103-07-01}} {{electromagnetic wave,
    IEV:121-11-63}} defined at a fixed point in space by the direction of the {{electric
    field strength, IEV:121-11-18}} vector or of any specified field vector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the direction of the vector varies with time, the property can be characterized
    by the locus described by the extremity of the considered field vector.
