  definition: '{{electromagnetic wave, IEV:121-11-63}} the energy of which, during
    propagation, remains confined between surfaces or in the vicinity of surfaces
    by reason of a sharp or progressive variation in the electromagnetic properties
    of the medium in the directions normal to these surfaces'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A guided electromagnetic wave can involve several {{electromagnetic modes, IEV:705-01-12}}.
