data:
  definition: location where the optic nerve joins to the retina and where there are
    no photoreceptors
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Because there are no photoreceptors at the blind spot, the retina cannot respond
    to light at this location.
  - The retinal location of the blind spot is about 15° nasal from the fovea in the
    visual angle and subtends about 7° in height and about 5° in width.
