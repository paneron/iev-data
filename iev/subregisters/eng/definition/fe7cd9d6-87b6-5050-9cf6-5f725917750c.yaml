  definition: 'if stem:[U] is the voltage at a given output derived from playing a
    reference signal of 1 000 Hz recorded at a velocity of stem:[v] cm/s, sensitivity
    at 1 000 Hz is given by:


    stem:[(U)/(v) mV // cm * s^(- 1)]


    where stem:[U] and stem:[v] are both either r.m.s. or peak values'
