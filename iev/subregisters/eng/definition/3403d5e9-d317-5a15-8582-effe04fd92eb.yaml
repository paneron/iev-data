  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the transfer of heat by forced
    convection in a fluid, defined by stem:[S t = (K)/((rho v c_p))], where stem:[K]
    is the coefficient of heat transfer, stem:[ρ] is mass density, stem:[v] is fluid
    speed, and stem:[c]~stem:[p]~ is specific heat capacity at constant pressure
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Stanton number is the ratio of Nusselt number stem:[Nu] to Péclet number stem:[Pe],
    thus stem:[St] = stem:[Nu]/stem:[Pe]. It is combined with the Prandtl number in
    the heat transfer factor ({{113-04-55, IEV:113-04-55}}).
