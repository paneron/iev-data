  definition: quotient of the spectral radiant flux reaching the exit internal surface
    of the layer and the spectral flux that enters into the layer after crossing the
    entry surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a given layer, the spectral internal transmittance depends on the path length
    of the radiation in the layer, and hence, in particular, on the angle of incidence.
  - The spectral internal transmittance has unit one.
