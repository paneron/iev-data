  definition: part of the time axis limited by two instants
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 A time interval comprises all instants between the two limiting instants and,
    unless otherwise stated, the limiting instants themselves.
  - 2 A time interval can be specified by the dates marking the initial instant and
    final instant or by one of these dates and the duration of the time interval.
  - 3 For the term “time interval”, the word “time” is often used, but is not recommended
    in this sense. The expression “time interval” is often used in the sense of “duration”
    ({{113-01-13, IEV:113-01-13}}) but this usage is deprecated to avoid confusion.
