data:
  definition: the third of a set of three orthogonal coordinate axes, called the roll,
    pitch and yaw axes, defined by convention for a spacecraft and used as a reference
    for locating elements of the spacecraft, for describing rotation of the spacecraft
    and for specifying the attitude of the spacecraft relative to a system of external
    coordinates
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a geostationary satellite the yaw axis is usually directed approximately towards
    the centre of the Earth.
