data:
  definition: that value of power carried by an {{electric line, IEV:151-12-27}} for
    which the {{electric line, IEV:151-12-27}} appears purely resistive due to the
    reactive power originating from the capacitance and the inductance of the {{electric
    line, IEV:151-12-27}} being equal
