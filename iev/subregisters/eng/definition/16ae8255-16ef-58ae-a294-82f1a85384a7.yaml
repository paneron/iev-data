    direction as the traffic
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Pro-beam lighting is characterized by using luminaires that show a luminous intensity
    distribution that is asymmetric in relation to the C90-C270 plane (the plane normal
    to the direction of the traffic), where the maximum luminous intensity is aimed
    in the same direction as the direction of the traffic.
