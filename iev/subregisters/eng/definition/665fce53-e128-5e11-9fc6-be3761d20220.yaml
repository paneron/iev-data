  definition: net diameter of filament derived from the electromagnetic behaviour
    between filaments
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The hysteresis loss, stem:[Q]~h~, is given as stem:[Q]~h~ = (8/3stem:[π])stem:[fd]~f~stem:[ηJ]~ct~stem:[B]~m~
    for a sufficiently high AC magnetic flux density stem:[B]~m~ to which stem:[Q]~h~
    is proportional, where stem:[f] is frequency, stem:[d]~f~ is effective filament
    diameter, stem:[J]~ct~ is transport critical current density and stem:[η] is volume
    fraction of the superconductor.
