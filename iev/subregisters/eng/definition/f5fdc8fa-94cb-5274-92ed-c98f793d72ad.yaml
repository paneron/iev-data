  definition: 'virtual magnetic flux in an area surrounded by a loop C


    stem:[Phi_C = Phi + mu_0 lambda^2 underset(C)( int ) J * d l]


    where stem:[Φ] is the magnetic flux in the area, stem:[λ] is the penetration depth,
    *stem:[J]* is the superconducting current density, stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic
    constant and d*stem:[l]* is a vector line element.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The fluxoid in a superconductor is quantized to a multiple of the flux quantum
    stem:[Φ]~0~.
  - The fluxoid is sometimes used instead of the fluxon which exists far from the
    surface of a superconductor.
