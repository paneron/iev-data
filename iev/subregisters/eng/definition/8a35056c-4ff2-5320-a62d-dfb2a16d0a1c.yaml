  definition: 'density of photon intensity with respect to projected area in a specified
    direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[L_p = ((d I_p))/((d A)) (1)/((cos alpha))]


    where stem:[I]~p~ is photon intensity, stem:[A] is area and stem:[α] the angle
    between the normal to the surface at the specified point and the specified direction'

  notes:
  - 'In a practical sense, the definition of photon radiance can be thought of as
    dividing a real or imaginary surface into an infinite number of infinitesimally
    small surfaces which can be considered as <a href="IEV845-21-033">point sources</a>,
    each of which has a specific photon intensity, stem:[I]~p~, in the specified direction.
    The photon radiance of the surface is then the integral of these photon radiance
    elements over the whole surface.


    The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative
    (i.e. a rate of change of photon intensity with projected area) and could alternatively
    be rewritten in terms of the average photon intensity, stem:[bar I_p], as:


    stem:[L_p = underset((A -&gt; 0))((lim)) ((bar I_p))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))].


    Hence, photon radiance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities;
    the area, stem:[A], should be small enough so that uncertainties due to variations
    in photon intensity within that area are negligible; otherwise, the quotient stem:[bar
    L_p = ((bar I_p))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))] gives the average photon radiance and
    the specific measurement conditions have to be reported with the result.'
  - For a surface being irradiated, an equivalent formula in terms of photon irradiance,
    stem:[E]~p~, and solid angle, stem:[Ω], is stem:[L_p = ((d E_p))/((d omega)) (1)/((cos
    theta))], where stem:[θ] is the angle between the normal to the surface being
    irradiated and the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source
    has no surface (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).
  - An equivalent formula is stem:[L_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d G))], where stem:[Φ]~p~ is
    photon flux and stem:[G] is geometric extent.
  - 'Photon flux can be obtained by integrating photon radiance over projected area,
    stem:[A]·cos stem:[α], and solid angle, stem:[Ω]:


    stem:[Phi_p = ​ ∬ L_p * cos alpha d A d omega].'
  - Since the optical extent, expressed by stem:[G·n]^2^, where stem:[G] is geometric
    extent and stem:[n] is refractive index, is invariant, the quantity expressed
    by stem:[L]~p~stem:[·n]^−2^ is also invariant along the path of the beam if the
    losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken as 0. That quantity is
    called "basic photon radiance".
  - 'The equation in the definition can also be described as a function of photon
    flux, stem:[Φ]~p~. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second
    partial derivative of the photon flux at a specified point (stem:[x], stem:[y])
    in space in a specified direction (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]) with respect to projected
    area, stem:[A]·cos stem:[α], and solid angle, stem:[Ω],


    stem:[L_p ( x , y , vartheta , phi ) = ((del^2 Phi_p ( x , y , vartheta , phi
    )))/((del A ( x , y ) * cos alpha * del omega ( vartheta , phi )))]


    where stem:[α] is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point
    and the specified direction.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiance". The corresponding photometric
    quantity is "luminance".
  - The photon radiance is expressed in second to the power minus one per square metre
    per steradian (s^−1^·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
