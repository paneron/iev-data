    a quantum device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an optical semiconductor source it is the ratio of the number of photons emitted
    to the number of electrons applied.
  - For an optical detector it is the ratio of the number of electrons generated in
    the photocurrent to the number of photons applied.
