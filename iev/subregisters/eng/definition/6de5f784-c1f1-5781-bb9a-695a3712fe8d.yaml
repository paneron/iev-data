data:
  definition: microstructural spatial region within the {{gas diffusion electrode,
    IEV:485-02-02}} with coexisting ionic and electronic conductivity, within which
    {{electrolyte, IEV:485-03-01}}, electrode and reactant (fuel or oxidant) coexist
    so the reactions of the {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}} can take place
