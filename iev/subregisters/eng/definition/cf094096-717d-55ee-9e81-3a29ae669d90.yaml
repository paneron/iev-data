data:
  definition: measure of the transfer characteristic of a modulation system as compared
    to an ideal (straight line) function, usually expressed as an allowable non-linearity
    in per cent of the specified full range deviation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Modulation linearity can also be expressed in terms of the permissible distortion
    of base-band signals produced by the modulation device (for example, intermodulation
    and harmonic distortion products shall not exceed –40 dB relative to the total
    modulating signal power).
  - 'Figure 19 is a plot of the output frequency of a typical modulated oscillator
    specified to have a modulation characteristic of 133,3 Hz/V over a range of ±
    3 V, with an allowed non-linearity of ± 5 %. Curve D is the actual characteristic
    compared with the ideal (curve A) and the limits (curves B and C).
