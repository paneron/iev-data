  definition: "element of a set containing the real numbers and other elements, which\
    \ may be represented by an ordered pair of real numbers (stem:[a], stem:[b]),\
    \ with following properties:\n\n\n\n* the pair (stem:[a], 0) represents the real\
    \ number stem:[a], \n\n* an addition is defined by stem:[( a_1 , b_1 ) + ( a_2\
    \ , b_2 ) = ( a_1 + a_2 , b_1 + b_2 )],\n\n* a multiplication is defined by stem:[(\
    \ a_1 , b_1 ) xx ( a_2 , b_2 ) = ( a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2 , a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 )]"

  notes:
  - All properties of real numbers (operations and limits) are extended to complex
    numbers except the order relation.
  - The complex number defined by the pair (stem:[a], stem:[b]) is denoted by stem:[c
    = a + j b] where j is the imaginary unit ({{IEV 102-02-10, IEV:102-02-10}}) represented
    by the pair (0, 1), stem:[a] is the real part and stem:[b] the imaginary part.
    A complex number may also be expressed as stem:[c = | c | ( cos phi + j sin phi
    ) = | c | e^(j phi)] where stem:[| c |] is a non-negative real number called modulus
    and stem:[φ] a real number called argument.
  - In electrotechnology, a complex number is usually denoted by an underlined letter
    symbol, for example stem:[underset(_)(c)].
  - The set of complex numbers is denoted by ℂ (C with a vertical bar in the left
    arc) or *C*. This set without zero is denoted by an asterisk to the symbol, for
    example ℂ*.
