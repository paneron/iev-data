  definition: 'quotient of the real difference in luminance between the target and
    its background, Δstem:[L], and the luminance difference needed between a target
    of a certain angular size and its background for the target to be just visible,
    Δstem:[L]~th~, that is at the threshold


    stem:[F]~VL~ = Δstem:[L] / Δstem:[L]~th~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The visibility level indicates how much the contrast of the target is above threshold
    contrast.
  - The visibility level has unit one.
