  notes:
  - Scanning mirrors are developed for laser printers, the scanning parts of optical  {{sensors,
    IEV:151-13-48}}, the heads for optical disks, displays and so on. An array of
    scanning mirrors can be fabricated on a silicon {{wafer, IEV:521-05-29}} with
    an {{actuator, IEV:151-13-49}} by micromachining technology.
