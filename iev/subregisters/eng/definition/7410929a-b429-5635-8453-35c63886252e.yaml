  definition: optional measure of the frequency stability in the frequency domain
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Incidental frequency modulation is best described in terms of the spectrum of
    the resultant base-band signal obtained by applying the oscillator signal to an
    ideal discriminator circuit of specified characteristics.
  - If the detection bandwidth is adequately specified, the incidental frequency modulation
    may be expressed as a fractional proportion of the output frequency (for example
    2 x 10^â€“8^ rms in a 10 kHz band).
