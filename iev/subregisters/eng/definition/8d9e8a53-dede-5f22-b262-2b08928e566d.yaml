  definition: 'reciprocal value of the open-loop gain response at the phase crossover
    angular frequency


    SEE: Figure 9.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In logarithmic representation of the open-loop gain response the value of the
    gain margin stem:[G]~m~ may be read as negative logarithm −lgstem:[G]~m~ at the
    phase crossover angular frequency. stem:[G]~m~ herein results from stem:[G]~m~
    = |stem:[G]~0~(jstem:[ω]~π~)|^–1^ (see Figure 10).
