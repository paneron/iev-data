  definition: system of ordered marks which can be attributed to instants on the time
    axis, one instant being chosen as the origin
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '1 A timescale may be chosen as:  * continuous, e.g. international atomic time
    (TAI) (see 713-05-18),  * continuous with discontinuities, e.g. coordinated universal
    time (UTC) (see 713-05-20) due to leap seconds, standard time due to summer time
    awinter time,* successive steps, e.g. usual calendars, where the time axis is
    split up into a succession of consecutive time intervals and the same mark is
    attributed to all instants of each time interval,* discrete, e.g. in digital techniques.'
  - 2 For physical and technical applications, a timescale with quantitative marks
    is preferred, based on a chosen initial instant together with a unit of measurement.
  - 3 Customary timescales use various units of measurement in combination, such as
    second, minute, hour, or various time intervals of the calendar such as calendar
    day, calendar month, calendar year.
