  definition: critical current density obtained by a magnetization measurement using
    a theoretical model (critical state model)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If a material is non-uniform or anisotropic, stem:[J]~cm~ differs from the transport
    critical current density, stem:[J]~ct~.
  - stem:[J]~cm~ takes sometimes smaller values than stem:[J]~ct~ because of the different
    electric field strength due to the flux creep especially for high temperature
    superconductors.
