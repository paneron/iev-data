  definition: the product of the mass energy transfer coefficient stem:[( ((mu_((tr))))/(rho)
    )] for that energy and (1â€“ stem:[g]) where stem:[g] is the fraction of the energy
    of secondary charged particles that is lost to bremsstrahlung in the material
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the material is air, stem:[((mu_((en))))/(rho)] is proportional to the quotient
    of exposure by energy fluence in the usual case of constant W.
