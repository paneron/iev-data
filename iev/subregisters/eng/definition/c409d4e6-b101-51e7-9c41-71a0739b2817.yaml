  definition: 'the quantity which characterizes the material dispersion defined as:


    stem:[M ( lambda ) = - (1)/((c_0)) ((d N))/((d lambda)) = ((lambda d^2 n))/((c_0
    d lambda^2))]


    where


    stem:[n] is the refractive index,


    stem:[N] is the group index,


    stem:[λ] is the wavelength in vacuum, and


    stem:[c]~0~ is the speed of light in vacuum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For many optical fibre materials, stem:[M] is zero at a specific wavelength stem:[λ]~0~,
    usually around 1300 nm. The sign convention is such that stem:[M] is positive
    for wavelengths shorter than stem:[λ]~0~ and negative for wavelengths longer than
    stem:[λ]~0~.
  - Pulse broadening caused by material dispersion in a unit length of optical fibre
    is give by stem:[M] times spectral linewidth (Δstem:[λ]), except at or near stem:[λ]
    = stem:[λ]~0~, where terms proportional to (Δstem:[λ])^2^ are important.
