  definition: 'unit of {{modulation rate, IEV:721-03-26}} in {{telegraphy, IEV:701-01-07}}
    and {{data communication, IEV:701-01-12}} and of {{line digit rate, IEV:704-17-03}}
    in {{digital transmission, IEV:704-01-08}}, equal to one second to the power minus
    one


    1 Bd := 1 s^−1^'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For example, if the duration of the unit interval is 20 ms, the modulation rate
    is 50 Bd.
  - The term “rapidité de modulation” is used in French in all cases, with the synonym
    “débit en ligne” in the case of digital transmission; in English the terms “modulation
    rate” and “line digit rate” are used in different fields.
