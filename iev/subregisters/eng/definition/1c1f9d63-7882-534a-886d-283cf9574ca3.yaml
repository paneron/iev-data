  definition: ratio of the complex quantity representing a time-varying quantity in
    terms of complex frequency at the output of a linear time-invariant two-port,
    to the complex quantity repre-senting the corresponding input quantity, the two
    complex quantities being defined in the same manner
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The complex quantities are generally the Laplace transforms of the time-varying
    quantities. In this case, the transfer function is the Laplace transform of the
    impulse response, and the term "fonction de transfert isomorphe" is used in French.
