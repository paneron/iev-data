  definition: "a) in relation to power cables:\n\npractice of laying single-core cables\
    \ so that each phase cable successively occupies, over approximately equal lengths\
    \ of the route, each geometrical position in the laying formation\n\nb) in relation\
    \ to shielding conductors:\r\npractice of laying a shielding conductor alongside\
    \ an elementary section of untransposed power cables so that, in relation to the\
    \ plane of symmetry of the cable laying formation, the conductor over one half\
    \ of the section length occupies one position and over the other half occupies\
    \ a symmetrically opposite position"
