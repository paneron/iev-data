data:
  definition: number of interruptions of supply to individual customers during a given
    time interval, divided by the product of the total number of customers and the
    duration of that time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If the power supply to customer stem:[j] is interrupted stem:[n]~stem:[j]~ times
    during a time interval of duration stem:[T], and the total number of customers
    served is stem:[N]~S~, then interruption frequency per customer served is given
    by


    stem:[f_((CS)) = ((sum_j n_j))/((N_S T))]'
  - Usually, only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Interruption frequency per customer served can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
