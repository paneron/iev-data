  definition: quotient of five times the sum of the area of the walls bounded by the
    floor and the working plane and the sum of the areas of the floor and the working
    plane, used in the calculation of the utilization factor or utilance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The floor cavity ratio is given by the formula


    stem:[K_f = ((5 h_f ( a + b )))/((a b))]


    where stem:[a] and stem:[b] are the dimensions of the sides of the room and stem:[h]~f~
    is the distance from the floor to the utilization plane.'
