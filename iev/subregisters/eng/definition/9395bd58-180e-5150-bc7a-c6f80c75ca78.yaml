  definition: 'density of incident luminous flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[E_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~v~ is luminous flux and stem:[A] is the area on which the luminous
    flux is incident'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Illuminance can be derived from the spectral irradiance distribution by


    stem:[E_v \ = \ K_m int_0^(oo) E_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[E]~e,stem:[λ]~(stem:[λ])
    is the spectral irradiance at wavelength stem:[λ] and stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is <a
    href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "irradiance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon irradiance".
  - The illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
