data:
  definition: spurious resonance caused by excitation of higher order transverse modes
    which appear at slightly higher frequencies
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It is desirable to apodize the IDT to match the desired transverse mode profile.
  - This entry was numbered 561-07-21 in IEC 60050-561:1991, Amendment 2:1997.
