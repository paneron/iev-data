  definition: for an ordered set of stem:[n] vectors in an stem:[n]-dimensional space
    with a given base, scalar attributed to this set by the unique multilinear form
    taking the value 0 when the vectors are linearly dependent and the value 1 for
    the base vectors
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When the coordinates of the stem:[n] vectors stem:[U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n] are
    arranged as columns or rows of an stem:[n xx n] matrix, the determinant of the
    vectors is equal to the determinant of the matrix:


    stem:[det ( U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n ) = | [[U_((11)),U_((12)),cdots,U_((1 n))],[U_((21)),U_((22)),cdots,U_((2
    n))],[vdots,vdots,ddots,vdots],[U_((n 1)),U_((n 2)),cdots,U_((n n))]] |]'
  - According to the sign of the determinant, the set of vectors and the given base
    have the same orientation or opposite orientations.
  - For the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the determinant of three vectors is
    the scalar triple product of the vectors.
