data:
  definition: portion of a cardiac cycle during which a fibrillation, in particular
    a ventricular fibrillation, can be triggered, especially by an electric current
    of sufficient magnitude
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The vulnerable period includes approximately one tenth to one fifth of the T-wave
    of the electrocardiogram and corresponds to the repolarization of cardiac cells
    that are in an inhomogeneous and hyper-excitable state.
