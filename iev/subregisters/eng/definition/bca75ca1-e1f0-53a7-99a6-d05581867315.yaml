  definition: 'product of the Planck constant and {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}


    stem:[Q]~p~ = stem:[h]·stem:[ν]


    where stem:[h] is the Planck constant and stem:[ν] is the frequency of the corresponding
    electromagnetic wave'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Photon energy can be emitted, transferred or received.
  - The energy of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic radiation</a>, stem:[Q]~PF~,
    by a photon flux of photons of frequency stem:[ν] is equal to the photon number,
    stem:[N]~p~, times the photon energy (stem:[Q]~PF~ = stem:[N]~p~·stem:[h]·stem:[ν]).
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant energy". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "<a href="IEV845-21-037">luminous energy</a>".
  - The photon energy is expressed in joule (J = W·s).
