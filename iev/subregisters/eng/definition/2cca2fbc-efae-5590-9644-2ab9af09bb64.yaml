data:
  definition: ratio of the series mode voltage causing a specified change in output
    information, to the voltage initiated by the measurand which would produce the
    same change
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The series mode rejection ratio is usually expressed in decibels and may depend
    on the frequency, the waveform and the method of measurement.
  - Series mode rejection ratio can also apply to quantities other than voltage.
