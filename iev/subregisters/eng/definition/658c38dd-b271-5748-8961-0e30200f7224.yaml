  definition: half the vertex angle of that cone within which optical power may be
    coupled into bound modes of an optical fibre
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Acceptance angle is a function of position on the entrance face of the core when
    the refractive index is a function of radius in the core. In that case, it is:


    stem:[arcsin n^2 ( r ) - n_2^2^(1 // 2)]


    where stem:[n] (stem:[r]) is the refractive index and stem:[n]~2~ is the minimum
    refractive index of the cladding.'
  - Power may be coupled into leaky modes at angles exceeding the acceptance angle.
