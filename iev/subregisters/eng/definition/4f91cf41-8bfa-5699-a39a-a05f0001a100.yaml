  definition: that region of space between the reactive near field region and the
    far field region, wherein the predominant components of the electromagnetic field
    are those which represent a propagation of energy, and wherein the angular field
    distribution is dependent upon the distance from the antenna
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the antenna has a maximum overall dimension which is not large compared to
    the wavelength, the radiating near field region may not be identifiable in practice.
