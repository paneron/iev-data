  definition: quotient of five times the sum of the area of the walls bounded by the
    working plane and the plane of the luminaires and the sum of the areas of the
    working plane and the plane of the luminaires, used in the calculation of the
    utilization factor or utilance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The room cavity ratio is expressed by the formula


    stem:[K = ((5 h ( a + b )))/((a b))]


    where stem:[a] and stem:[b] are the dimensions of the sides of the room and stem:[h]
    the mounting height, that is the distance between the working plane and the plane
    of the luminaires.'
