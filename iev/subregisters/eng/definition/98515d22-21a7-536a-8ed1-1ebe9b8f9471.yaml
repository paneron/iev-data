  definition: 'stem:[delta ( epsilon ) = - ln ((Phi^( '' )_e))/((Phi_e))]


    where stem:[Φ]~e~ is the radiant flux of a collimated beam entering the upper
    limit layers of the atmosphere at an angle stem:[ε] to the vertical, and stem:[Phi^(
    '' )_e] is the attenuated radiant flux of that beam reaching the surface of the
    Earth'
