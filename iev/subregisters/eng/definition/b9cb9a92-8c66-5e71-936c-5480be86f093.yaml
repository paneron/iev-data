  definition: constant representing the efficiency of electromechanical coupling
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'It represents the efficiency of converting electric energy into mechanical energy
    by the electro-mechanical coupling effect, and it is defined as the square root
    of the ratio of the mechanical energy stored (stem:[U]~m~) to the total input
    electric energy transferred (stem:[U]~i~):


    stem:[k = sqrt(((U_m ))/((U_i)))]'
