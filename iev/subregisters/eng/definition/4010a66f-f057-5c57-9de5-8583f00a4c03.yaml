data:
  definition: absolute value of the difference between the limiting frequencies of
    a {{frequency band, IEV:103-09-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bandwidth is the range of the frequency band, characterized by a single value.
    It does not depend on the position of the band in the frequency spectrum.
  - The term “bandwidth” is usually associated with a qualification; for example,
    baseband bandwidth, necessary bandwidth, bandwidth of an amplifier or other device.
