  definition: for a particle, its mass when moving in an inertial frame
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 A particle with rest mass stem:[m]~0~ and speed stem:[v] has a relativistic
    mass equal to stem:[m_0 // sqrt(1 - v^2 // c_0^2)], where stem:[c]~0~ is speed
    of light. When the speed stem:[v] is non-zero, the relativistic mass is greater
    than the rest mass.
  - 2 In the theory of relativity, the term “mass” generally means relativistic mass.
