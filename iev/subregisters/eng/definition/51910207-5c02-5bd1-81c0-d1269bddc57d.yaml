    space region and depending on the position of the point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A field quantity may be a function of time or any other parameter.
  - In English the term "field quantity", in French "grandeur de champ", is also used
    to denote a quantity, the square of which is proportional to power, whereas quantities
    proportional to power are called "power quantities", whether or not the quantities
    depend on the position of a point (see {{IEV 702-02-08, IEV:702-02-08}}). According
    to ISO 80000-1:2009, Annex C, the preferred term is then “root-power quantity”.
