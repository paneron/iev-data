  definition: '{{device, IEV:151-11-20}} intended to detect {{arc faults, IEV:442-05-66}}
    and provide a signal for operation of a mitigation or current interruption device


    NoteÂ 1 to entry: An arc flash protection device relies primarily on sensing other
    than traditional {{overcurrents, IEV:151-15-28}}, such as light sensing, pressure
    sensing, and current spectra sensing. The device can, or not, use traditional
    current sensing as an additional signal.'
