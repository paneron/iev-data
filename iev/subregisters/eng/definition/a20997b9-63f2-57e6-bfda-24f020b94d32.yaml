  definition: a method of source coding in which each picture is divided into sub-pictures,
    a linear transform is performed on each sub-picture signal, and then the resulting
    signal is converted into a digital signal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The most common form of transform coding uses a discrete transform, most often
    a discrete cosine transform (DCT), and results in a sequence of coefficients which
    are quantized and coded with the aim of reducing the bit rate of the signal.
