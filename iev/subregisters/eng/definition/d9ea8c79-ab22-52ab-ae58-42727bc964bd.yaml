data:
  definition: smallest detectable difference between the values of energy of two particles
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In common practice the energy resolution is expressed by a factor that is the
    absolute or relative full width at half maximum respectively, and in the former
    case is divided by the energy of the peak of the distribution curve for mono-energetic
    particles.
