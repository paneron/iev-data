  concept: 4589cef7-6eb8-5aca-be46-103834ca1533
  definition: magnetic material having low coercivities for the magnetic flux density
    as well as for the magnetic polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A specific value of coercivity defining the boundary between magnetically hard
    and soft materials cannot easily be stated but it generally lies in the range
    1 kA/m to 10 kA/m.
