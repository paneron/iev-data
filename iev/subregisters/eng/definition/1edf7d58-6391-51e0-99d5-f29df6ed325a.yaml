  definition: model describing the magnetic flux distribution in a type II superconductor
    in which the flux density gradient is assumed to be equal to stem:[μ]~0~stem:[J]~c~,
    where stem:[μ]~0~ is the magnetic constant and stem:[J]~c~ is the critical current
    density, whenever the magnetic flux density is not zero
