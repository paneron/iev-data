  definition: for an {{electromagnetic wave, IEV:121-11-63}} incident on a plane boundary
    between two regions having different {{refractive indices, IEV:702-02-19}}, that
    {{angle of incidence, IEV:705-04-03}} at which the {{reflectance, IEV:845-04-58}}
    is zero for  a wave that has one of its vectors of {{electric field, IEV:121-11-67}}
    in the plane defined by the {{direction of propagation, IEV:103-10-05}} and the
    normal to the surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The vector of electric field is the electric field strength in optics, and the
    electric flux density in {{radiocommunication, IEV:701-01-31}}.
  - In radiocommunication, the term Brewster's angle is often used for the complement
    of the angle defined above.
  - For propagation from a medium of refractive index stem:[n]~1~ to a medium of refractive
    index stem:[n]~2~, Brewster's angle is arctan (stem:[n]~2~/stem:[n]~1~).
