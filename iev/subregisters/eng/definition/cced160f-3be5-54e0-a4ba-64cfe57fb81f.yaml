  definition: for a non-ideal differential amplifier, ratio of the gain with respect
    to a difference signal at the inputs to the gain with respect to a common-mode
    signal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A large common-mode rejection ratio is generally sought after for instrumentation
    in electrobiology, where unwanted common-mode signals are often present.
