  definition: quantity in a conventionally chosen subset of a given system of quantities,
    where no quantity within the subset can be expressed in terms of the others
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The subset mentioned in the definition is termed the set of base quantities. The
    International System of Quantities (ISQ) is defined by a set of seven base quantities.
  - Base quantities are referred to as being mutually independent since a base quantity
    cannot be expressed as a product of powers of the other base quantities.
  - The quantity “number of entities” can be regarded as a base quantity in any system
    of quantities.
