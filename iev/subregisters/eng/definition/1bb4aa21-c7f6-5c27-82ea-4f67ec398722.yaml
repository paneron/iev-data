  definition: for a linear non-radiating two-terminal element or circuit under sinusoidal
    conditions, ratio of the absolute value of the reactive power to the active power
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quality factor is a measure of the losses, usually unwanted, particularly
    in a capacitor or an inductor. It is equal to the ratio of the absolute value
    of reactance to the resistance or, equivalently, the ratio of the absolute value
    of the susceptance to the conductance.
  - The quality factor depends generally on frequency and voltage.
  - In French, the term “facteur de surtension” is in common usage, even if there
    is no overvoltage.
