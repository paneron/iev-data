  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the magnetic constant
    stem:[μ]~0~ and by the magnetic field strength stem:[*H*] is equal to the magnetic
    polarization stem:[*J*]:


    stem:[*J*] = stem:[μ]~0~ stem:[κ] stem:[*H*]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In an isotropic medium the magnetic susceptibility is a scalar; in an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor.
