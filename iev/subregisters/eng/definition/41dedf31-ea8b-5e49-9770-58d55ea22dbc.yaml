  definition: Lambert's law for a surface element whose radiance or luminance is the
    same in all directions of the hemisphere above the surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Lambert''s cosine law can be expressed by


    stem:[I](stem:[θ]) = stem:[I]~n ~cos stem:[θ]


    where stem:[I](stem:[θ]) and stem:[I]~n~ are the radiant intensities or luminous
    intensities of the surface element in a direction at an angle, stem:[θ], from
    the normal to the surface and in the direction of that normal, respectively.'
