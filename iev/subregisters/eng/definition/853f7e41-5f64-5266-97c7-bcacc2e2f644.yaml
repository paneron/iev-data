  definition: 'scalar div *stem:[U]* associated at each point of a given space region
    with a vector *stem:[U]*, equal to the limit of the flux of the vector which emerges
    from a closed surface S, divided by the volume of the interior of the surface
    when all its geometrical dimensions become infinitesimal


    stem:[div U = underset((V -&gt; 0))((lim)) (1)/(V) underset(S)( ∯ ) U * e_n d
    A]


    where *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface element oriented outwards and
    stem:[V] is the volume'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the divergence is:


    stem:[div U = ((del U_x))/((del x)) + ((del U_y))/((del y)) + ((del U_z))/((del
    z))]'
  - The divergence of the vector field *stem:[U]* is denoted div *stem:[U]* or *∇*
    ⋅ *stem:[U]*.
