  definition: a radionuclide used to follow biological, chemical or other processes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Since the stable nuclides and radionuclides of an element have essentially the
    same chemical properties, and the radioactive ones are readily detected, the movement
    and behaviour of the stable atoms can be traced by following the radioactive atoms.
