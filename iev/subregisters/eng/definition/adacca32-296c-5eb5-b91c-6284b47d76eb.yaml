  definition: limit, if it exists, of the quotient of the conditional probability
    that the repair is completed within time interval (stem:[t], stem:[t] + Δstem:[t])
    and Δstem:[t], when Δstem:[t] tends to zero, given that the repair started at
    stem:[t] = 0 and had not been completed before time stem:[t]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The instantaneous repair rate is related to repair time ({{192-07-19, IEV:192-07-19}})
    and its constituent parts.
  - The unit of measurement of instantaneous repair rate is the unit of time to the
    power −1.
