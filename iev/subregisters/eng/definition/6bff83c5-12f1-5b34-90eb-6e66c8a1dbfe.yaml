  definition: a gas discharge with a cathode drop which is small compared with that
    of a glow discharge

  notes:
  - Electrons are released from the cathode mainly by thermionic emission and high
    field emission, acting simultaneously or separately. Emission of electrons released
    by ion bombardment plays only a small part.
