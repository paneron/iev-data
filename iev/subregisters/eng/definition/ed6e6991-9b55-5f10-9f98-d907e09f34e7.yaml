  definition: 'control structure with interconnected subprocesses in which each partial
    control equipment takes into account only the information from its associated
    subprocess to form its output information


    SEE: Figure 24.'

  notes:
  - A compact process computer system realises decentralized control structures if
    simple controllers are used for every control loop, without taking into consideration
    any links between subprocesses.
