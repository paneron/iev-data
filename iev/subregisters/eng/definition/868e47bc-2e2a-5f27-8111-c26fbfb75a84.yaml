  definition: attenuation, with respect to frequency, of the output of a reproducing
    transducer when compared to the output of an ideal reproducing transducer
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reproducing loss may be due in disk recording to the finite dimensions of
    the reproducing stylus tip, or to groove wall deformations, and in magnetic recording
    to the magnetic head gap length and/or head core losses, during reproduction.
