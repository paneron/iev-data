  definition: 'one million times the amount by which the modified refractive index
    exceeds unity:


    stem:[M = 10^6 ( n + (h)/(a) - 1 ) = N + 10^6 (h)/(a)]


    where


    stem:[n] is the refractive index,


    stem:[N] is the refractivity,


    stem:[h] is the altitude,


    stem:[a] is the radius of the Earth'
