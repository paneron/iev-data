data:
  definition: a sequence of identical duty cycles, each cycle consisting of a period
    of operation at constant load corresponding to a predetermined speed of rotation,
    followed by one or more periods of operation at other constant loads corresponding
    to different speeds of rotation (carried out for example by means of a change
    of the number of poles in the case of induction motors). There is no rest and
    de-energized period
