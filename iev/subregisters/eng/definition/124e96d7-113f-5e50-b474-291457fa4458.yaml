  definition: '{{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} {{unit, IEV:112-01-14}} of time, equal to 9 192
    631 770 {{periods, IEV:103-06-01}} of the {{ground-state, IEV:113-06-08}} hyperfine
    transition of the unperturbed caesium 133 {{atom, IEV:113-05-20}}'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of
    time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency
    Δstem:[ν]~Cs~, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of
    the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which
    is equal to s^−1^."'
  - The reference to an unperturbed atom is intended to make it clear that the definition
    of the second is based on an isolated caesium atom that is unperturbed by any
    external field, such as ambient black-body radiation.
  - As explained in {{IEV 113-01-13, IEV:113-01-13}}, Note 5, the quantity name “duration”
    is more precise than the loose term “time”.
  - 'The second is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: second (s),
    {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}} (m), {{kilogram, IEV:112-02-06}} (kg), {{ampere, IEV:112-02-07}}
    (A), {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), {{mole, IEV:112-02-09}} (mol) and {{candela,
    IEV:112-02-10}} (cd).'
