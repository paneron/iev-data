  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,



    . for stem:[n] positive quantities stem:[x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n], by the positive
    stem:[n]th root of their product:


    stem:[X_g = ( x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n )^(1 // n)]


    .  for a quantity stem:[x] depending on a variable stem:[t], by the quantity stem:[X_g]
    calculated from the values of the quantity stem:[x](stem:[t]) by the expression


    stem:[log ((X_g))/((x_((ref)))) = (1)/(T) int_( 0)^( T) log ((x ( t )))/((x_((ref))))
    d t]


    where stem:[x_((ref))] is a reference value'

  notes:
  - The geometric mean value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The geometric mean value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript g to
    the symbol of the quantity.
