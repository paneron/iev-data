  definition: 'time integral of erythemal irradiance


    stem:[H_((er)) = int int E_(lambda) ( lambda , t ) s_((er)) ( lambda ) d lambda
    d t]


    where stem:[Eλ](stem:[λ], stem:[t]) is spectral irradiance and stem:[s]~er~(stem:[λ])
    is the erythema spectral weighting function normalized to 1 at its maximum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the actinic effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-26-068">minimal erythema dose</a>", "<a href="IEV845-26-069">standard
    erythema dose</a>".
  - The erythemal dose is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^).
