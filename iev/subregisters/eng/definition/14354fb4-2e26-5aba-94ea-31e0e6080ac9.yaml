  definition: product of the ion activities of the ions resulting from the dissociation
    of a solute in a saturated solution, raised to powers equal to their stoichiometric
    numbers
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For the dissociation of a salt A~stem:[m]~B~stem:[n]~ → stem:[m]A + stem:[n]B,
    the solubility product is stem:[K]~SP~ = stem:[a]^stem:[m]^(A) ⋅ stem:[a]^stem:[n]^(B),
    where stem:[a] is ionic activity and stem:[m] and stem:[n] are the stoichiometric
    numbers.
