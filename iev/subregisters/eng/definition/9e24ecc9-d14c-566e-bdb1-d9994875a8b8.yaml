  definition: product of <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>
    and maximum luminous efficacy for a specified photometric condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic).
    If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the symbol stem:[K](stem:[λ])
    is used. For other photometric conditions, the respective symbol for identification
    shall be used.
  - 'Spectral luminous efficacy for photopic vision is expressed by


    stem:[K](stem:[λ]) = stem:[K]~m~ stem:[V](stem:[λ])


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is spectral
    luminous efficiency and stem:[λ] is wavelength.'
  - The spectral luminous efficacy is expressed in lumen per watt (lm·W^−1^).
