  definition: of a microphone, for a specified frequency, quotient of the output open-circuit
    voltage by the sound pressure, at the position previously occupied by the microphone
    reference point, in the undisturbed sound field produced by a human head and mouth,
    or by a specified source that simulates the acoustical characteristics of a human
    head and mouth
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the load impedance is other than that of an open circuit, it shall be specified.
  - This definition is relevant only to microphones used close to the mouth.
