  examples: []
  notes:
  - Historically, host names identified specific machines; today host names may identify
    functions.
  - In general a host name is a fully qualified domain name, for example, "www. iec.ch
    " identifies a host in the domain " iec.ch ". If a host is addressed in the same
    local domain, the name of this domain may be omitted.
