data:
  definition: the propagation distance over which propagating optical radiation may
    be considered to be coherent radiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the spectral linewidth of the source is Δstem:[λ] and the central wavelength
    is stem:[λ]~0~, the coherence length in a medium of refractive index stem:[n]
    is approximately stem:[λ]~0~^2^/n.Δ.stem:[λ].
