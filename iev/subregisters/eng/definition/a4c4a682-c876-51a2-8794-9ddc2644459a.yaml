  definition: 'at each point of a given space region, vector *stem:[U]*, the rotation
    of which is the vector *stem:[V]* of a given solenoidal field


    *stem:[V]* = *rot stem:[U]*'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The given vector field is said to be derived from the vector potential.
  - The vector potential is not unique since any irrotational field can be added to
    a given vector potential without changing its rotation. The vector potential is
    often chosen so that its divergence is zero.
  - The vector potential is used, for example, to represent the magnetic vector potential
    (*stem:[A]*), the rotation of which is the magnetic flux density (*stem:[B]*).
