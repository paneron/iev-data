data:
  definition: ratio of total useable energy flow ({{net electric power, IEV:485-14-03}}
    and recovered heat flow) to the total enthalpy flow supplied to the {{fuel cell
    power system, IEV:485-09-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The supplied total (including reaction enthalpy) enthalpy flow of the {{raw fuel,
    IEV:485-07-01}} should be related to the lower heating value (LHV) for a better
    comparison with other types of energy conversion system.
