data:
  definition: electromagnetic wave delay line fabricated from superconductors used
    for matching of the phase of signals in electronic circuits in the typical frequency
    range of 300 MHz to 30 GHz
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Because high frequency loss in superconductors is very small, delay line can be
    fabricated with very small insertion loss.
