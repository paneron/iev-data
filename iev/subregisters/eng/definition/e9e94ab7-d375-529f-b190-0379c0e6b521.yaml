  definition: for wave propagation, the limit at a given instant and point in space
    of the vector representing the displacement of a given characteristic of the field
    during a given interval, divided by the duration of this time interval when it
    approaches zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Depending on the choice of the characteristic, different types of velocities can
    be defined, such as phase velocity vector, group velocity vector, with magnitudes
    depending on the considered point and direction.
