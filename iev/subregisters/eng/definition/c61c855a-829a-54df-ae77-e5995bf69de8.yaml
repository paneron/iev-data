    is perpendicular to the direction of illumination by the Sun
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Normal solar illuminance is not the same as direct solar illuminance, which is
    measured on a horizontal surface on the Earth, not necessarily perpendicular to
    the direction of illumination by the Sun.
  - The normal solar illuminance is expressed in lux (lx = lm·m^−2^).
