  definition: 'quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-050">luminance</a> at a surface
    element of a medium in a given direction and the <a href="IEV845-21-060">illuminance</a>
    on the medium


    stem:[q_v = ((L_v))/((E_v))]


    where stem:[L]~v~ is luminance and stem:[E]~v~ is illuminance'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is similar to the
    luminance coefficient except that it is defined for directional incident radiation.
  - The luminance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus one (sr^âˆ’1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-71 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
