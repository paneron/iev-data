  definition: '{{actuator, IEV:151-13-49}} that uses an alloy that changes shape on
    heating and returns to its original shape on cooling'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Shape-memory alloy actuators are compact, light, and produce large forces. These
    actuators can be driven repeatedly in a heat {{cycle, IEV:103-05-08}} or can be
    controlled arbitrarily by switching the electric current through the actuator
    itself. Lately, attempts have been made to use the alloys to build a servosystem
    that has an appropriate feedback mechanism and a cooling system, intended for
    applications where quick response is not necessary. Application examples under
    development are {{microgrippers, IEV:523-04-15}} for cell manipulation, {{microvalves,
    IEV:523-04-17}} for regulating very small amounts of flow and active endoscopes
    for medical use.
