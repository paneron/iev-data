  definition: tubular elastomeric sleeve forming part of a sealing sleeve cable clamp
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The purpose of the sealing sleeve is three-fold:


    1) it converts some of the axial force imparted by the outlet-nut to inward radial
    force, thereby achieving electrical contact pressure between the cable braid and
    a ferrule inserted beneath the braid,


    2) it exerts an axial thrust against the flange of the ferrule thereby achieving
    electrical contact pressure between the ferrule and the connector body,


    3) it provides mechanical anchorage and sealing between the cable and the connector
    body by the action of the combined inward and outward radial pressures.'
