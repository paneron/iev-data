  definition: reflection for which the modulus of the reflection factor of a specular
    surface separating two dielectric media is unity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Total reflection occurs when the refractive index of the second medium is less
    than that of the first and the angle of incidence is greater than a critical value.
  - When total reflection occurs, there is an evanescent field in the second medium.
