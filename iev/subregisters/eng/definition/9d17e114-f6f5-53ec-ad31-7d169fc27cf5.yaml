  definition: sum of the harmonic components of a periodic quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The harmonic content is a time function.
  - For practical analysis, an approximation of the periodicity may be necessary.
  - The harmonic content depends on the choice of the fundamental component. If it
    is not clear from the context which one is used an indication should be given.
