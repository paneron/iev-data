  definition: quotient of the quantity of heat penetrating into an interior through
    the glazing and the solar radiant energy incident on that glazing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The solar factor is the sum of two quantities: the radiant transmittance, stem:[τ]~e~,
    of the glazing and the quantity equal to the quotient of the convected and radiated
    heat gain from the glazing into the interior, stem:[Q]~2~, and the solar radiant
    energy, stem:[Q]~1~, incident on the glazing:


    stem:[g] = stem:[τ]~e~ + stem:[Q]~2~ / stem:[Q]~1~'
  - The solar factor has unit one.
