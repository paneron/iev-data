  definition: frequency of an electromagnetic disturbance causing an unintended response
    from a given equipment
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the case of a receiver tuned to frequency stem:[f]~0~, many spurious frequencies
    stem:[f]~s~ can be found from the following formulae:


    stem:[f_s = (1)/(m) ( n f_L +- f_I )]


    or


    stem:[f_s = ((f_0))/(h)]


    where


    stem:[f]~L~ is the local oscillator frequency,


    stem:[f]~I~ is the intermediate frequency,


    stem:[m], stem:[n], and stem:[h] are integers.'
