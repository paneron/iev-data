  definition: for two vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* in an stem:[n]-dimensional
    Euclidean space, tensor of the second order defined by the bilinear form stem:[f
    ( X , Y ) = ( U * X ) ( V * Y )], where *stem:[X]* and *stem:[Y]* are any vectors
    in the same space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bilinear form can be represented by stem:[f ( X , Y ) = ( underset(i)( sum
    ) U_i X_i ) ( underset(j)( sum ) V_j Y_j ) = underset((i j))( sum ) U_i V_j X_i
    Y_j] in terms of the coordinates of the vectors. The dyadic product is then the
    tensor with components stem:[T_((i j)) = U_i V_j].
  - The dyadic product of two vectors is denoted by stem:[U ox V] or stem:[U V].
