  definition: 'polyphase system in which the stem:[m] quantities have the same amplitude
    and initial phases given by


    stem:[vartheta_0 - 2 pi ((( i - 1 ) k))/(m)]


    where stem:[vartheta_0] is the initial phase of one of the quantities which is
    arbitrarily chosen out of the set stem:[i] = 1, 2, ..., stem:[m], and stem:[k]
    is a characteristic of the system, equal to one of the integers 0, 1, 2, ...,
    stem:[m] âˆ’ 1'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The symmetric polyphase system is a degenerated polyphase system for stem:[k]
    = 0 and for some combinations of stem:[k] and stem:[m].
