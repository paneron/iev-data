  definition: quantity of dimension 1 equal to the ratio of displacement Δstem:[x]
    of one surface of a layer of thickness stem:[d] to the other surface parallel
    to it, to this thickness, thus stem:[γ] = Δstem:[x] / stem:[d]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In anisotropic media, shear strain may depend on the orientation of the layer
    and may be described by a tensor.
