  definition: exchangeable noise {{power spectral density, IEV:702-04-50}} at a given
    {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} of a {{one-port, IEV:131-12-64}} divided by Boltzmannâ€™s
    constant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition assumes that quantum effects are negligible.
  - The spot noise temperature has the sign of the real part of the one-port {{impedance,
    IEV:131-12-43}}. When the real part is positive, the {{exchangeable power, IEV:702-07-11}}
    becomes the {{available power, IEV:702-07-10}}.
  - If the one-port has an impedance with a positive real part, its spot noise temperature
    at a given frequency equals the {{thermodynamic temperature, IEV:113-04-14}} to
    which a {{resistor, IEV:151-13-19}} equal in value to the real part of the impedance
    should be brought in order to obtain an available power of {{thermal noise, IEV:702-08-45}}
    equal to the available noise power of the one-port at the same frequency.
  - A receiving antenna can be regarded as a one-port when viewed from its {{output
    port, IEV:131-12-62}}.
