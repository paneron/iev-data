  concept: 5e6a8a6e-684a-5396-94ca-def08ba3bbc4
  definition: pertaining to time-independent electric quantities such as voltage or
    current, to devices operated with direct voltage and current, or to quantities
    associated with these devices
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The notation "DC" is preferred in English to the notation "d.c." which is an abbreviation
    of "direct current".
  - French language uses also the expression "courant continu" with an appropriate
    preposition such as "en", "de", "Ã " or "pour", or only the adjective "continu".
  - 'For the marking of electric equipment, either the notation DC or the appropriate
    graphical symbol may be used. Example: DC 500 V.'
  - 'According to ISO 31-0 and IEC 60027-1, unit names and unit symbols shall not
    be qualified by "DC" as an attachment. Example: stem:[U]~DC~ = 500 V is correct,
    stem:[U] = 500 V~DC~ or stem:[U] = 500 V DC are incorrect.'
