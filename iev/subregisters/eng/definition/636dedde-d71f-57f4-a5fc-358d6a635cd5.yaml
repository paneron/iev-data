  definition: quantity proportional to the number of elementary entities of a specified
    nature which are contained in a given sample of matter, the proportionality coefficient
    being the same for all samples
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '1 The elementary entities must be specified and may be of any kind: atoms, molecules,
    ions, electrons, holes, other particles or quasi-particles, groups of particles,
    double bonds, etc.'
  - 2 The proportionality coefficient in the definition is the reciprocal of the Avogadro
    constant stem:[N]~A~, thus stem:[N] = stem:[nN]~A~, where stem:[N] is the number
    of elementary entities.
  - 3 The term "amount of substance" is to be interpreted as a whole, not as a combination
    of two terms. However, the words “of substance” could be replaced by words to
    specify the substance concerned in any specific application, e.g. “amount of hydrogen
    chloride, HCl”.
  - 4 Amount of substance is one of the seven base quantities in the International
    System of Quantities, ISQ, on which the International System of Units, SI, is
    based. The coherent SI unit of amount of substance is mole, symbol mol (see IEC
    60050-112:2010, {{112-02-09, IEV:112-02-09}}).
