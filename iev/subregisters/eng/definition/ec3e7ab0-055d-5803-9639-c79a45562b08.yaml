  definition: law stating that when a point on the retina is excited by a light stimulus
    that undergoes periodic variations in magnitude at a {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}
    that exceeds the <a href="IEV845-22-093">critical flicker frequency</a>, the visual
    perception produced is identical to that produced by a steady stimulus whose magnitude
    is equal to the mean magnitude of the variable stimulus taken over one period
