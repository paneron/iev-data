  definition: quantity characterizing the variation with thermodynamic temperature
    stem:[T] of the distance stem:[l] between two points of a body, under given conditions,
    thus stem:[alpha_l = (1)/(l) ((d l))/((d T))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Usually the condition is absence of external forces.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of linear expansion coefficient is kelvin to the power
    minus one, K^âˆ’1^.
