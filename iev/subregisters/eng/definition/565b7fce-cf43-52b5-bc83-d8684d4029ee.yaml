  definition: in a given direction, the ratio of the available power at the terminals
    of a receiving antenna to the power flux density of a plane wave incident from
    that direction, the wave being polarization matched to the antenna
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction corresponding to maximum available
    power is implied.
  - The total effective area is the sum of the partial effective areas for any two
    orthogonal polarizations of components of the antenna polarization.
  - 'In free space, the effective area stem:[A]~e~ for a given direction of an antenna
    when used for reception is related to the absolute gain stem:[G]~i~ for the given
    direction when the same antenna is used for transmission by the equation:


    stem:[G_i = ((4 pi A_e))/((lambda^2))]


    where stem:[Î»] is the wavelength.'
  - When an aperture illumination function is uniform in amplitude and phase and the
    given direction is perpendicular to the aperture, the total effective area of
    a radiating aperture of a lossless antennas is equal to its geometric area.
