data:
  definition: frequency interval of the wind turbulence spectrum, where eddies, after
    attaining isotropy, undergo successive break-up with negligible energy dissipation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At a typical 10 m/s wind speed, the inertial sub-range is roughly from 0,02 Hz
    to 2 kHz.
