  definition: current delivered by a {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}}, at a given voltage,
    referred to the mass of {{electrocatalyst, IEV:485-01-02}} in the {{electrodes,
    IEV:485-02-01}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The specific activity can also be referred to the {{electrochemical surface area,
    IEV:485-02-09}}, or the volume of the {{catalyst layer, IEV:485-02-06}}. These
    can be referred to as area specific activity or volume specific activity, respectively.
  - The specific activity is usually expressed in A/g, and can be expressed as A/cm^2^
    or A/cm^3^.
