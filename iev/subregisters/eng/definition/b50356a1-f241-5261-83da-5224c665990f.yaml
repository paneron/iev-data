  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the apparent power delivered
    to a specified load after insertion of a given two port device between the source
    and the load, to the apparent power that the same source would deliver to a load
    with zero reflection factor at its interface with the source
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the composite gain is less than one, its decibel value is
    negative, and its converse or its opposite value in decibels called composite
    loss may be used.
