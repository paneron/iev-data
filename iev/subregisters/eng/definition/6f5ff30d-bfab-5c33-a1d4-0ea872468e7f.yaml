  definition: phenomenon by which {{energy, IEV:113-03-45}} in the form of {{electromagnetic
    waves, IEV:121-11-63}} or {{photons, IEV:113-05-14}} emanates from a source and
    is transferred through space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “electromagnetic radiation” is also used for the electromagnetic waves
    or photons produced (see {{IEV 705-02-01, IEV:705-02-01}}).
  - The physical concepts of photons and electromagnetic waves are used to describe
    the same phenomenon of transmission of radiant energy in different ways, depending
    on the nature of the interaction of the energy with the physical world (wave-particle
    dualism).
