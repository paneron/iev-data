  definition: a variation of the physical conditions of a medium characterized by
    a field and moving with a velocity defined at each point and in each direction
    by the properties of this medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A wave is produced by a local action or by a set of such actions.
  - Wave propagation can be described only by such fields that may be represented
    by partial differential equations of hyperbolic type. For example, electromagnetic
    energy is propagated in space or waves, but propagation of heat in rods has no
    definite velocity and so is not a wave propagation.
