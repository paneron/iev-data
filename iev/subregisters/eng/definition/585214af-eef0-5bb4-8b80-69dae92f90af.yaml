  definition: '{{amount of data, IEV:171-02-09}} that can be contained in a {{storage
    device, IEV:171-04-14}}, expressed as a number of specified {{data elements, IEV:171-02-01}}'
  examples:
  - Storage capacity for bits, stem:[M]~b~ or stem:[M]~bit~; storage capacity for
    bytes, stem:[M]~B~ (or for octets, stem:[M]~o~).
  notes:
  - The specified data elements depend on the organization of the storage device,
    for example, {{binary elements, IEV:171-02-10}}, {{bytes, IEV:171-02-12}}, {{words,
    IEV:171-02-27}} of a given number of bits, {{blocks, IEV:721-03-11}}. A subscript
    referring to a specified data element can be added to the symbol.
  - For {{registers, IEV:171-04-19}}, the term "register length" is used with the
    same meaning.
