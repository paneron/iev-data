  definition: surface integral, the differential element of which is the scalar product
    of a vector and the vector surface element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The flux through a surface S of the vector *stem:[V]* is denoted by stem:[underset(S)(
    ∬ ) V * e_n d A]. If the surface is closed, the flux is denoted by stem:[underset(S)(
    ∯ ) V * e_n d A].
