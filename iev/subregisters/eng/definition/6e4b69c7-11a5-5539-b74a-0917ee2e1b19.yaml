  definition: '{{code, IEV:101-12-04}} according to which a larger number of characters,
    symbols or signal elements than strictly necessary are used to represent {{information,
    IEV:701-01-01}}'
  examples:
  - '{{Error detecting code, IEV:702-05-19}}; {{error correcting code, IEV:702-05-20}}.'
  notes:
  - In telegraphy, a five-unit code using all the characters of {{International Telegraph
    Alphabet No. 2, IEV:721-09-10}} is not redundant. A seven-unit code such as {{International
    Telegraph Alphabet No. 3, IEV:721-09-11}} which uses only signals made of four
    elements of {{A condition, IEV:721-03-19}} and three elements of {{Z condition,
    IEV:721-03-20}} is redundant.
