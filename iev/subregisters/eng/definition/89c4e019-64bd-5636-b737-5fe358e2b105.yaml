  definition: an hypothetical antenna symmetrical with an actual antenna with respect
    to a plane, and traversed by electric currents of the same instantaneous value
    as the actual currents at the points of symmetry, the current components having
    the same direction as the actual currents when normal to the plane and the opposite
    directions when parallel
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The combination of the actual antenna and the image antenna will produce the same
    radiation pattern above the plane as the combination of the actual antenna and
    the plane if the latter is a perfect conductor and is infinite in extent.
