  definition: '{{vector product, IEV:102-03-36}} of the {{electric field strength,
    IEV:121-11-18}} stem:[*E*] and the {{magnetic field strength, IEV:121-11-56}}
    stem:[*H*] of the {{electromagnetic field, IEV:121-11-61}} at a given point

  notes:
  - The flux of the Poynting vector through a closed surface is equal to the electromagnetic
    power passing through this surface.
  - For a periodic electromagnetic field, the time average of the Poynting vector
    is a vector the direction of which, with certain reservations, can be considered
    as being the {{direction of propagation, IEV:705-02-15}} of {{electromagnetic
    energy, IEV:121-11-64}} and the {{magnitude, IEV:102-03-23}} can be considered
    as being the average {{power flux density, IEV:705-02-03}}.
