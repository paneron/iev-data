  definition: a discharge with slight luminosity produced in the neighbourhood of
    a conductor, without greatly heating it, and limited to the region surrounding
    the conductor in which the electric field exceeds a certain value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a corona stabilizer tube, this usually occurs in a high-voltage, low-current
    (of the order of microamperes) region, between two unheated electrodes immersed
    in a gas at a pressure above a few millimetres of mercury.
