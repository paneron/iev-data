  definition: 'cloudless sky for which the relative luminance distribution is given
    by the luminance gradation function, stem:[φ](stem:[Z]), which relates the luminance
    of a sky element to its zenith angle, stem:[Z]:


    stem:[phi ( Z ) = 1 - e^(((- 0,32))/((cos Z)))] if stem:[0 &lt;= Z (pi)/(2)],
    and stem:[phi ( Z ) = 1]


    if stem:[Z = (pi)/(2)] (at the horizon)'
