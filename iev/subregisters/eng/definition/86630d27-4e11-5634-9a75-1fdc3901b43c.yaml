  definition: mean value of photon irradiance on the outer curved surface of a very
    small (real or imaginary) cylinder that is oriented vertically at a point in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Photon cylindrical irradiance is sometimes also defined as the arithmetic mean
    of the vertical photon irradiance, stem:[E]~p,v~, at a point


    stem:[E_((p ,c)) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_0^((2 pi)) E_((p ,v)) d phi]


    where stem:[E]~p,v~ is the vertical photon irradiance for an area element with
    its normal in the direction stem:[φ], and stem:[φ] is the angle in the plane perpendicular
    to the axis of the cylinder.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "cylindrical irradiance". The corresponding
    photometric quantity is "cylindrical illuminance".
  - The photon cylindrical irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one
    per square metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
