  definition: maximum voltage that can be applied to the connection facilities of
    associated apparatus without invalidating intrinsic safety
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This additionally applies to the maximum voltage that can be applied to connection
    facilities of intrinsically safe apparatus when located in a non-hazardous area
    (for example, charging connections on battery operated apparatus, where charging
    is only done in the non-hazardous area).
  - The value of stem:[U]~m~ can be different at different sets of connection facilities,
    and can be different for AC and DC voltages.
