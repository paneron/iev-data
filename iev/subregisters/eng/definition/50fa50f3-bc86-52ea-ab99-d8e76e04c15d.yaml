  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the active power delivered
    to a specified load after insertion of a given two-port device between the source
    and the load, to the available power of the source
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the transducer gain is less than one, its decibel value
    is negative, and its converse or its opposite value in decibels called transducer
    loss can be used.
