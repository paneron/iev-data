data:
  definition: that dispersion in a signal attributable to the dependence of the phase
    and group velocities on wavelength due to the geometric properties of the fibre
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For optical fibres the dependence is on the ratio (a/stem:[λ]), where a is core
    radius and stem:[λ] is wavelength.
