  definition: non-SI unit for conventional retinal illuminance and natural pupil luminance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the eye is viewing a surface of uniform luminance, the numerical value of
    the conventional retinal illuminance or the natural pupil luminance, expressed
    in troland, is equal to the product of the area in square millimetres of the limiting
    pupil, natural or artificial, by the luminance of the surface in candela per square
    metre.
