  definition: the oscillation frequency at which a plasma, locally disturbed by an
    excess or depletion of electrons, reverts to its macroscopic state of neutral
    equilibrium, supposing that the ions remain fixed in position
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The plasma frequency stem:[f]~p~ is given by the equation:


    stem:[f_p = (e)/((2 pi)) sqrt(((n_e))/((m epsilon_0)))]


    where stem:[e] is the electron charge, stem:[m] is the electron mass, stem:[n]~e~
    is the electron density, stem:[Îµ]~0~ is the electric constant.'
