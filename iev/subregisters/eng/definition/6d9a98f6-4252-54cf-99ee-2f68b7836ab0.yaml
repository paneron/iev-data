  definition: 'self-acting artificial system the behaviour of which is governed either
    in a stepwise manner by given decision rules or continuously in time by defined
    relationships, while the output variables of which are created from its input
    and state variables


    Note 1 to entry:  An essential characteristic of a program controlled automaton
    is the existence of at least one branching in the program, offering different
    alternatives of control actions between which a decision is made based on external
    inputs or inner states. Deactivation, too, is an alternative branch of the program.
    The program sequence is triggered or controlled by an external stimulus which
    is part of an external input or the input itself.




    EXAMPLE 2: A machine tool which automatically executes operations under program
    control is an automaton. Examples: automatic lathe, milling machine.


    Note 2 to entry: A controller, governed by the defined relationships in a control
    loop is an automaton.


    EXAMPLE 3: In a temperature controller a reference variable is set, which will
    be compared with the feedback variable. Based on the result of the comparison
    the controller drives the final controlling equipment. In other words, based on
    the difference between the reference variable and the feedback variable (representing
    the temperature as controlled variable) the controller and the final controlling
    equipment influence the temperature via the manipulated variable (output variable).

  examples:
  - '1: In a vending machine the program is started by inserting a coin. The program
    can respond in two ways: either accept the coin and release the article or return
    the coin with the article output remaining blocked. The decision is made based
    on the result of the check of the inserted coin and the article stock.'
