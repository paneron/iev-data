  definition: text message transferred in real time from a sender to one or several
    recipients specified by the sender
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The fact that the recipients are specified by the sender distinguishes an instant
    message from a message in a computer conference, and in particular in a chat.
  - Some instant messaging services allow the transfer of picture or audio files,
    etc. as a supplement to a text message.
