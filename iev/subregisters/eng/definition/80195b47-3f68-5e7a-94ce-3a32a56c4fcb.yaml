  definition: "a photodiode with a large intrinsic region sandwiched between P- and\
    \ N-doped semiconducting regions used for the detection of optical radiation\r\
    \n<note absorbed in this region create electron-hole pairs that are then separated\
    \ by an electric field thus generating a photocurrent.></note>"
