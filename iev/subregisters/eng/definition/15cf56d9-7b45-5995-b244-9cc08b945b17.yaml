  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the radiation intensity
    produced by an antenna in a given direction, to the value of the radiation intensities
    averaged in all directions in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - The directivity is independent of antenna losses and equal to the absolute gain
    in the same direction if the antenna is lossless.
