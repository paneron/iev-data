  definition: highest average wind speed, averaged over stem:[t] sec, that is likely
    to be experienced within a specified time period (recurrence period) of stem:[T]
    years
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Recurrence periods of stem:[T] = 50 years and stem:[T] = 1 year and averaging
    times of stem:[t] = 3 s and stem:[t] = 10 min are used in a number of standards.
    In popular language the less precise term “survival wind speed” is often used.
    In practice, however, the wind turbine generator system is designed using the
    extreme wind speed for design load cases.
