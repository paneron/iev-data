  definition: part of the luminous flux of a light source that contributes predominantly
    to the lighting task
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For non-directional light sources, the useful luminous flux is the total luminous
    flux of the light source.
  - For directional light sources the useful luminous flux is the partial luminous
    flux in a defined cone angle, the axis of the cone being the optical beam axis
    of the light source.
  - The cone angle, stem:[α], which can be expressed either in degree (°) or radian
    (rad), is given by the full conic angle and has to be specified, e.g. stem:[Φ]~u,90°~
    or stem:[Φ]~u,π/2~.
  - The optical beam axis of a light source is the axis about which the luminous intensity
    is substantially symmetrical.
  - The useful luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
