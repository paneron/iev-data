  definition: 'for an inductive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, quotient
    of the linked flux stem:[Ψ] between the terminals by the electric current stem:[i]
    in the element


    stem:[L = (Psi)/(i)]


    where the sign of the linked flux is determined by taking the voltage, in the
    time integral defining it, as the difference of the electric potentials at terminals
    at A and B, and where the current is taken as positive if its direction is from
    A to B and negative if its direction is from B to A'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An inductance cannot be negative.
  - In French, the term “inductance” is also a short term for “bobine d’inductance”,
    in English “inductor” ({{151-13-25, IEV:151-13-25}}).
  - The coherent SI unit of inductance is henry, H.
