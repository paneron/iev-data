  definition: inverse of the radius of curvature stem:[ρ], thus stem:[κ] = 1/stem:[ρ]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 Curvature is the limiting value of the quotient of the difference of the angles
    of the tangents in two neighbouring points on a curve by their distance, when
    this distance tends to zero
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of curvature is metre to the power minus one, m^−1^.
