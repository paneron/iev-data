  definition: <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> for which the wavelengths
    are longer than those for <a href="IEV845-21-003">visible radiation</a>

  notes:
  - 'For infrared radiation, the range between 780 nm and 1 mm is commonly subdivided
    into:




    * IR-A: 780 nm to 1 400 nm, or 0,78 μm to 1,4 μm;


    * IR-B: 1,4 μm to 3,0 μm;


    * IR-C: 3 μm to 1 mm.'
  - A precise border between "visible radiation" and "infrared radiation" cannot be
    defined because visual sensation at wavelengths greater than 780 nm can be experienced.
  - In some applications the infrared spectrum has also been divided into "near,"
    "middle," and "far" infrared; however, the borders necessarily vary with the application.
