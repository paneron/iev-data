  definition: "unique positive value, if it exists, associated with a three-dimensional\
    \ domain, with the following properties:\n\n\n\n* for a rectangular parallelepiped,\
    \ the value is the product of the three side lengths, \n\n* for a disjoint union\
    \ of domains, the value is the sum of the values associated to these domains,\
    \ \n\n* for more complicated domains, the value can be approximated by sums and\
    \ given by an integral"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The volume stem:[V] of the three-dimensional domain D is determined by the volume
    integral stem:[underset(D)( âˆ­ ) d V], where dstem:[V] is the volume element ({{IEV
    102-05-10, IEV:102-05-10}}).
  - In the usual geometrical space, the volume is a quantity of dimension length cubed.
