data:
  definition: a form of non-linearity distortion characterized by the presence of
    intermodulation products in the signal at the output of a non-linear device or
    transmission medium
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Intermodulation distortion can be expressed quantitatively as the ratio of the
    amplitude of intermodulation products of various orders to the amplitude of two
    or more sinusoidal input oscillations of specified amplitude and frequency.
