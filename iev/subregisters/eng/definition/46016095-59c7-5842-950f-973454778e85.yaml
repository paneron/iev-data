  definition: difference between the electric potentials at two points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The electric potential difference stem:[V]~b~ âˆ’ stem:[V]~a~ between two points
    a and b is equal to the negative of the line integral, along any path linking
    points a and b, of the irrotational vector stem:[( E + ((del A))/((del t)) )],
    where stem:[*E*] is the electric field strength, stem:[*A*] a magnetic vector
    potential and stem:[t] the time:


    stem:[V_b - V_a = - int_((r_a))^((r_b)) ( E + ((del A))/((del t)) ) * d r]


    where stem:[*r*]~a~ and stem:[*r*]~b~ are the position vectors for a and b, respectively,
    and dstem:[*r*] is the vector line element.'
