  definition: radiation that exhibits no preferential directional property in a plane
    normal to the direction of propagation of the radiation, the direction and phase
    of the electric field vector being randomly distributed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A beam of unpolarized radiation can be regarded as being composed of two components
    of equal amplitude but with orthogonal states of polarization, the two components
    being unrelated in phase.
