  definition: the frequency of rotation of a charged particle of specified nature
    describing, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, a helical curve around
    the lines of force of the field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The gyro-frequency stem:[f]~c~ is given by the expression:


    stem:[f_c = (1)/((2 pi)) ((q B))/(m)]


    where stem:[B] is the magnetic flux density, stem:[m] and stem:[q] are the mass
    and the charge of the particle respectively.'
