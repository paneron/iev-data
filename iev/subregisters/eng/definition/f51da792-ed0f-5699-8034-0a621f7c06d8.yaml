  definition: a voltage transformer intended to transmit an information signal to
    protective and control devices
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The accuracy class of a protective voltage transformer is designated by its class
    index followed by the letter "P" (standing for "Protection"). The class index
    gives the limit of the absolute value of the voltage error from 5% of rated voltage
    to a voltage corresponding to the rated voltage factor.
