  definition: microwave resonator fabricated from superconductors used in the typical
    frequency range of 300 MHz to 30 GHz
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Because the surface resistance of the superconductor at microwave frequencies
    is extremely low, the microwave superconducting resonator can be made with quality
    factors (stem:[Q]) far in excess of those fabricated from conventional materials.
