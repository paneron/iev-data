  definition: medium which can be electrically polarized and in which a time-varying
    electric field produces an electric current density the vector component of which
    in a given direction has a magnitude small compared with that of the vector component
    of the displacement current density in this direction, in a particular frequency
    band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'For sinusoidal conditions in an isotropic medium, the medium is dielectric if
    the following relation is satisfied:


    stem:[(gamma)/((epsilon_0 omega)) ≫ epsilon^( '' )_r]


    where stem:[γ] is the conductivity, stem:[ε]~0~ the electric constant, stem:[ω]
    the angular frequency and stem:[ε]′~r~ the real relative permittivity.'
  - An anisotropic medium may be dielectric only in certain directions.
