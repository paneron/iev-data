  definition: variation in the magnitude of an {{electromagnetic field, IEV:121-11-61}}
    or in the power of a {{signal, IEV:701-01-02}}, due to time variations in the
    propagation conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When a reference value, such as the free space value, is used, the term “fading”
    can be restricted to a temporary and significant decrease in the magnitude of
    the electromagnetic field or in the power of the signal relative to this reference
    value.
