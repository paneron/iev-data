  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the flow of a fluid in a given
    configuration characterized by a specified length stem:[l], defined by stem:[R
    ​ e = ((rho v l))/(eta) = ((v l))/(nu)], where the fluid is described by its mass
    density stem:[ρ], speed stem:[v], dynamic viscosity stem:[η], and kinematic viscosity
    stem:[ν]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The Reynolds number characterizes the relative importance of inertia and viscosity
    in a fluid flow.
  - 2 When the Reynolds number is less than a critical value stem:[Re]~crit~, laminar
    flow is stable. For higher values of stem:[Re], laminar flow becomes unstable.
    The critical value depends on the configuration.
  - 3 In case of a fluid flowing through a circular tube with diameter stem:[d], the
    specified length is stem:[l] = stem:[d], and the critical value of the Reynolds
    number is stem:[Re]~crit~ ≈ 2 300.
