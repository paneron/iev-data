  definition: <a href="IEV845-27-027">high-intensity discharge lamp</a> in which the
    major portion of the light is produced, directly or indirectly, by radiation from
    mercury operating at a partial pressure in excess of 100Â kPa
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "high-pressure mercury lamp" includes clear lamps, phosphor-coated (mercury
    fluorescent) lamps and <a href="IEV845-27-029">blended lamps</a>. In a fluorescent
    mercury discharge lamp, the light is produced partly by the mercury vapour and
