  definition: energy due to the position in a force field, equal to the opposite of
    the line integral along a curve C of a conservative force *stem:[F]*, thus stem:[V
    = - int_C F * d r], where d*stem:[r]* is vector line element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 A force is conservative when the force field *stem:[F]*(*stem:[r]*) is static
    and irrotational, i.e. *rot* *stem:[F]* = *0*, in a simply connected domain.
  - 2 Force *stem:[F]* is the gradient of potential energy stem:[V], thus *stem:[F]*
    = *grad* stem:[V]. See also “potential” (113-03-19).
