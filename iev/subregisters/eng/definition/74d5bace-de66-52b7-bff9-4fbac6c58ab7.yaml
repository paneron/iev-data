  definition: luminaire that cannot easily be moved from one place to another, either
    because the fixing is such that the luminaire can only be removed with the aid
    of a tool, or because it is intended for use out of {{arm's reach, IEV:195-06-12}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In general, fixed luminaires are designed for permanent connection to the power
