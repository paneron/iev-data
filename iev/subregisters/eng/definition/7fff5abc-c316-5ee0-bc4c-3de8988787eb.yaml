  definition: form of fault-tolerant software design in which several diverse modules
    are invoked in sequence to perform a given task until one of them is successful
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Each of the modules is capable of performing the given task, but in a different
    way. ‘Success’ is judged by the fact that the output satisfies an acceptance test
    performed by an adjudicator. A module in the sequence is invoked only if all earlier
    modules fail.
  - If a module fails then backward error recovery is performed before invoking the
    next module.
  - The recovery block scheme is an example of standby redundancy.
