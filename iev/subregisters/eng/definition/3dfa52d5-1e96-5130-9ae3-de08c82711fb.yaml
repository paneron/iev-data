data:
  definition: 'radiation detector filled with air, a suitable gas, or a gaseous mixture,
    in which an electric field is provided for the total collection, at the electrodes,
    of charges associated with the ions and the electrons produced in the sensitive
    volume of the detector by the ionizing radiation


    EXAMPLE


    *  pulse ionization chamber, *  integration ionization chamber, *  current ionization
    chamber, *  free air ionization chamber.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric field is not sufficient to produce gas multiplication.
  - This entry was numbered 394-25-02 in IEC 60050-394:2007.
