  definition: propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a homogeneous ideal dielectric
    medium which may be considered of infinite extent in all directions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For propagation in free space, the magnitude of each vector of the electromagnetic
    field in any given direction from the source is proportional to the reciprocal
    of the distance from the source beyond a distance determined by the size of the
    source and the wavelength.
