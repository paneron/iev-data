  definition: frequency where the admittance value of a lossless resonator becomes
    zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'When the electromechanical coupling factor is low, an approximate value of the
    frequency is given by the expression


    stem:[f_p = (1)/((2 pi sqrt(L_1 ((C_1 C_0))/((C_1 + C_0)))))]


    where stem:[C]~0~ represents the shunt capacitance and stem:[L]~1~ and stem:[C]~1~
    the motional inductance and the motional capacitance respectively. The expression
    can be derived from Figure 2 by letting stem:[R]~1~ = 0.
