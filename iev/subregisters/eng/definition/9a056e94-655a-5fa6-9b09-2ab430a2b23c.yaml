  definition: 'density of exiting radiant flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[M_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~e~ is radiant flux and stem:[A] is the area from which the radiant
    flux leaves'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For Planckian radiation, stem:[M]~e~ = stem:[σT]^4^ where stem:[σ] is the Stefan-Boltzmann
    constant and stem:[T] is thermodynamic temperature.
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous exitance". The corresponding
    photon quantity is "photon exitance".
  - The radiant exitance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-47 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
