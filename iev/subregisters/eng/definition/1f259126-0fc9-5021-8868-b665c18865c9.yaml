  definition: 'quotient ramp response Δstem:[v]~ρ~(stem:[t]) divided by the ramp slope
    stem:[K]~ρ~ of the ramp function, the quotient described by


    stem:[r ( t ) = (1)/((K_(rho))) * Delta v_(rho) ( t )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The unit-ramp response may be calculated from the unit-step response by


    stem:[r ( t ) = int_((- oo))^t h ( tau ) d tau].'
  - The unit-ramp response of a system mathematically may be considered to result
    from application of a unit ramp to an input variable.
