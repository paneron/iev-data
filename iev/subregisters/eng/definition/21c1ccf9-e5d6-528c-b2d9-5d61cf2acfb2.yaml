data:
  definition: the ratio stem:[G/T], usually expressed in logarithmic units, of the
    absolute gain stem:[G] of an antenna to the antenna-receiver noise temperature
    stem:[T] referred to the antenna terminals at a specified frequency and in specified
    conditions of installation and operation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the noise temperature is expressed in kelvins and the gain as a power ratio,
    the quantity 10 lg stem:[G/T] is expressed in a unit designated by the symbol
    dBK.
