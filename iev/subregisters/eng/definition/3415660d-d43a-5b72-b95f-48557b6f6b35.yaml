  definition: for two points A and B in a Euclidean point space, magnitude of the
    vector stem:[r_B - r_A], where stem:[r_A] and stem:[r_B] are the position vectors
    of the points A and B, respectively
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the usual geometrical three-dimensional space, the Euclidean distance is a
