  definition: under sinusoidal conditions, circuit-theory theorem stating that the
    voltage across a passive linear two-terminal network connected to any two terminals
    of a linear network is equal to the short-circuit current between the two terminals
    before the connection divided by the sum of the admittance of the two-terminal
    network and the admittance of the network seen from the two terminals before the
    connection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Norton theorem can be generalized to non-sinusoidal conditions.
