data:
  definition: basic subdivision of an antenna which is designed to support the radio-frequency
    currents or fields that contribute directly to the radiation pattern of the antenna
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An antenna may comprise one or more radiating elements.
  - A radiating element may be driven or not driven.
  - Some parts of the antenna, such as struts, may support parasitic radio-frequency
    currents or fields which can cause the desired radiation of the antenna to be
    perturbed.
