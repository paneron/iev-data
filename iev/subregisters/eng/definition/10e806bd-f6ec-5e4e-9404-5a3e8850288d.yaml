  definition: passive stem:[n]-terminal circuit element characterized by functional
    relations between the voltages between any two terminals and the electric currents
    at the terminals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric energy absorbed by an resistive stem:[n]-terminal element is not
    recoverable as electric energy at the terminals.
