        modification: Combination of EXAMPLE 1 to EXAMPLE 5 into a single EXAMPLE,
          addition of a new Note 1 to entry, and renumbering and revision of NOTE
          1 and NOTE 2 to Note 1 and 2 to entry respectively.
        type: modified
  concept: e1a62e21-f99e-588b-b638-7ed191769a79
  definition: property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, where the property has
    no magnitude
  examples:
  - sex of a human being, colour of a paint sample, ISO two-letter country code, sequence
    of amino acids in a polypeptide.
  notes:
  - While the colour of a paint sample is sometimes considered to be a nominal property,
    it is also recognized that a pure colour can be characterized by the wavelength
    of electromagnetic radiation, which is a quantity that can be measured.
  - A nominal property has a value, which can be expressed in words, by alpha-numerical
    codes, or by other means. This value is not to be confused with the nominal value
    of a quantity (see {{IEV 151-16-09, IEV:151-16-09}}).
  - Nominal properties are distinguished from quantities, which are properties that
    have a magnitude, i.e. they can be compared in terms of greater or lesser.
