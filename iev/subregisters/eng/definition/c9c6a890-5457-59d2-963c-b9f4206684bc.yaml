  definition: 'the fractional decrease of permeability of a magnetic material measured
    at constant temperature at the beginning and at the end of a given time interval:


    stem:[D = ((mu_1 - mu_2))/((mu_1))]


    where stem:[µ]~1~ and stem:[µ]~2~ are the values of the permeabilities at the
    beginning and at the end of the given interval respectively'
