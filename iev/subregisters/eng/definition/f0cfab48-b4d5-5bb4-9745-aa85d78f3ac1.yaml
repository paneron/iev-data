  definition: 'identity resulting from the divergence theorem applied to the vector
    field stem:[f_1 grad f_2], where stem:[f]~1~ and stem:[f]~2~ are two scalar fields
    given at each point of a three-dimensional domain V limited by a closed surface
    S


    stem:[underset(V)( ∭ ) ( grad f_1 * g r a d f_2 + f_1 Delta f_2 ) d V = underset(S)(
    ∯ ) f_1 g r a d f_2 * e_n d A]


    where dstem:[V] is the volume element, *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface
    element and Δ is the Laplacian operator'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In English the first Green formula is sometimes called “first Green theorem” or
    “first Green identity”.
