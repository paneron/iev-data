  definition: monostatic or bistatic ionospheric sounding based on the spectral analysis
    of radio signals scattered at random by the electrons in the ionosphere, this
    scattering being due to fluctuations in the ionospheric plasma of thermal origin
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Incoherent scatter ionospheric soundings enable the following quantities to be
    determined: electron density, electron temperature, ion temperature, mean ionic
    mass and ion drift.'
