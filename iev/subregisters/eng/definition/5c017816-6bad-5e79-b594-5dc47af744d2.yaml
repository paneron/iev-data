  definition: tensor of the fourth order defined by the four-linear form equal to
    the product of the bilinear forms defining two tensors of the second order on
    the same Euclidean space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The components of the tensor product of the tensors stem:[T] and stem:[S] are:
    stem:[(( T ox S ))_((i j k l)) = T_((i j)) S_((k l))].'
  - The tensor product of two tensors is denoted by stem:[T ox S].
