  definition: neutron or photon detector that produces an electrical signal through
    neutron and photon activation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The signal results from the emission of electrons from neutron capture and absorption
    of gamma rays.
  - In a nuclear reactor, a set of collectrons which are carefully arranged in the
    reactor core to measure the neutron flux and thus determine the (axial and radial)
    power distribution and monitor changes over time.
