  definition: voltage pulse of a specified shape applied during dielectric tests,
    with a time to crest of 100 μs to 300 μs, and a time to half value of a few milliseconds
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The switching impulse is defined by the two figures giving these durations in
    microseconds; in particular the standard switching impulse is 250/2 500 μs.
