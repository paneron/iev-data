  definition: departure of the {{output voltage, IEV:485-13-03}} of a {{fuel cell,
    IEV:485-08-01}} from the thermodynamic value as a consequence of irreversible
    processes within the components of the fuel cell
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Polarization gives rise to loss of {{efficiency, IEV:485-10-01}} and increases
    with {{faradaic current, IEV:485-12-04}} passing through the cell.
