  definition: 'distortion of voltage waveform caused by a non-linear relation between
    the magnetic flux density and the magnetic field strength in the magnetic core
    and expressed in decibels by:


    stem:[THD] &amp;equals; 20 lg(stem:[V]~m~/stem:[V]~f~) dB


    where


    stem:[V_m = sqrt(sum_((n = 1))^(oo) V_n^2)]


    stem:[V]~stem:[n]~ is the amplitude of the stem:[n]-th harmonic component of the
    waveform and stem:[V]~f~ is the amplitude of its fundamental component'
