  definition: at a stated operating point and frequency, the quotient of (1) the fundamental
    frequency component of the voltage at the accessible terminal of an electrode
    by (2) the sinusoidal current applied to that terminal to cause that voltage,
    all other terminal potentials being maintained constant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For infinitesimal amplitudes, this is the reciprocal of the electrode admittance.
