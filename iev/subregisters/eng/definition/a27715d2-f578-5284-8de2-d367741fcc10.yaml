data:
  definition: maximum permissible deviation of the oscillator frequency from a specified
    nominal value when operating under specified conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "Frequency tolerances are often assigned separately to specified ambient effects,\
    \ namely electrical, mechanical and environmental. When this approach is used,\
    \ it is necessary to define the values of other operating parameters as well as\
    \ the range of the specified variable, that is to say:\n\n* deviation from the\
    \ frequency at the specified reference temperature due to operation over the specified\
    \ temperature range, other conditions remaining constant; \n\n* deviation from\
    \ the frequency at the specified supply voltage due to supply voltage changes\
    \ over the specified range, other conditions remaining constant; \n\n* deviation\
    \ from the initial frequency due to ageing, other conditions remaining constant;\
    \ \n\n* deviation from the frequency with specified load conditions due to changes\
    \ in load impedance over the specified range, other conditions remaining constant.\
    \ \n\nIn some cases, an overall frequency tolerance may be specified, due to any\
    \ or all combinations of operating parameters, during a specified lifetime."
