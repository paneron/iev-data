  definition: probability of performing as required for the time interval (stem:[t]~1~,
    stem:[t]~2~), under given conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Given conditions include aspects that affect reliability, such as: mode of operation;
    stress levels; environmental conditions; and maintenance, where applicable.'
  - It is usually assumed that the item is in a state to perform as required at the
    beginning of the time interval.
  - When stem:[t]~1~ = 0 and stem:[t]~2~ = stem:[t], then stem:[R](0, stem:[t]) is
    denoted simply as stem:[R](stem:[t]) and termed the reliability function, or survival
    function of the item. See IEC 61703, _Mathematical expressions for reliability,
    availability, maintainability and maintenance support terms_, for more details.
  - See also reliability, &lt;of an item&gt; ({{192-01-24, IEV:192-01-24}}).
