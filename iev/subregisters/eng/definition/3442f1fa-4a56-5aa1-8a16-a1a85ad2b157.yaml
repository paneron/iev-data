  definition: micromachining that removes a part of the {{substrate, IEV:521-05-28}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An example of bulk micromachining is a processing method based on etching by a
    chemical solution to remove unnecessary parts of a substrate. Covering the areas
    to be preserved with a mask of SiO~2~ or Si~3~N~4~ ensures that etching cannot
    progress below the surface. Also, a boron-doped layer can stop the etching of
    the part below the surface layer. Recently, {{silicon fusion bonding, IEV:523-06-05}}
    has been used to fabricate still more complex structures.
