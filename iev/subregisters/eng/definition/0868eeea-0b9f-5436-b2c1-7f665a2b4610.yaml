  definition: the extreme value of the active power that can be delivered at a given
    frequency by a source directly connected to a load when the complex reflection
    factor at the interface is widely varied
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The extreme value of power is obtained with matching of the load to the source.
  - By convention the exchangeable power assumes the sign of the real part of the
    source impedance. If this real part is positive the extreme value is a maximum
    and the exchangeable power is identical to the available power.
