  definition: 'of electrical steel, the ratio of the difference between the peak value
    of the magnetic field strength stem:[hat H_(alpha)] measured at an angle stem:[Î±]
    to the direction of rolling, and the peak value of the magnetic field strength
    stem:[hat H_0] measured along the direction of rolling, to stem:[hat H_0], at
    a stated peak value of the magnetic flux density, the ratio being expressed as
    a percentage:


    stem:[T_H = ((hat H_(alpha) - hat H_0))/((hat H_0)) xx 100 %]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The measurements of stem:[hat H_(alpha)] andstem:[hat H_0] are to be made under
    the same conditions.
