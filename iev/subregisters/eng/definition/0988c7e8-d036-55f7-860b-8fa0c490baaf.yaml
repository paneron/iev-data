  definition: '1. the direction of the electric field strength vector, if this direction
    is constant in a transverse cross-section of a waveguide


    2. the direction of the electric field strength vector of a mode at, or close
    to the intersection of two axes of symmetry, if these axes are the only axes of
    symmetry at right angles of the mode in any transverse cross-section'
