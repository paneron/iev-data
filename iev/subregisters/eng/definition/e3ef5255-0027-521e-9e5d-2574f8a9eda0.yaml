data:
  definition: function, zero for all negative values of the independent variable and
    equal to one for all positive values
  examples: []
  notes:
  - See Figure 1 below for a graphical representation of ε(stem:[t]). The value ε(0)
    may remain undefined or may be defined according to the context.
  - ε(stem:[x] − stem:[x]~0~) denotes a unit step at the value stem:[x]~0~ of the
    independent variable stem:[x].
  - 'Notation H(stem:[x]) is also used. Notation ϑ(stem:[t]) is used for the unit
    step function of time. Notation ϒ(stem:[x]) has also been used.
