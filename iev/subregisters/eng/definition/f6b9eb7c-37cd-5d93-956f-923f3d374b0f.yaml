data:
  definition: luminous intensity of a source that has a constant output, of the same
    <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> as the flashing light,
    which would have the same <a href="IEV845-31-026">luminous range</a> (or <a href="IEV845-31-052">visual
    range</a> in aviation terminology) as the flashing light under identical conditions
    of observation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For practical purposes, a conventional effective intensity can be evaluated for
    a flashing light from photometric data by an agreed method.
  - The effective intensity is expressed in candela (cd).
