  definition: for a continuous body in a domain D, with mass density stem:[ρ](*stem:[r]*),
    point with position vector stem:[r_G = ((int_D r rho d V))/((int_D rho d V))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 For a system of particles with masses stem:[m]~stem:[i]~ and position vectors
    *stem:[r]*~stem:[i]~, the centre of mass is the point with position vector stem:[r_G
    = ((sum_i m_i r_i))/((sum_i m_i))].
  - 2 In non-relativistic physics, the centre of mass doesn’t depend on the chosen
    reference frame.
