  definition: function of the whole message without a secret key
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In contrast to a message authentication code there is no secret key involved.
    The expression "whole message" is meant to include any implicit data of the message
    which are not sent to the transmission system. The manipulation detection code
    is often based on a hash function.
