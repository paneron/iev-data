  definition: 'vector quantity obtained at a given point by adding the electric polarization
    *stem:[P]*  to the product of the electric field strength *stem:[E]*  and the
    electric constant stem:[ε]~0~ :


    *stem:[D]* = stem:[ε]~0~ *stem:[E]* + *stem:[P]*'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the electric flux density is at all points equal to the product of
    the electric field strength and the electric constant:


    *stem:[D]* = stem:[ε]~0~ *stem:[E]*'
  - 'The divergence of the electric flux density is equal to the volumic electric
    charge stem:[ρ] :


    div *stem:[D]* = stem:[ρ]'
