data:
  definition: environment where the hazard of electric shock by arc welding is increased
    in relation to normal arc welding conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Such environment is found for example


    a)  in locations in which freedom of movement is restricted, so that the operator
    is forced to perform the welding in a cramped (e.g. kneeling, sitting, lying)
    position with physical contact with conductive parts;


    b)  in locations which are fully or partially limited by conductive elements,
    and in which there is a high risk of unavoidable or accidental contact by the
    operator;


    c)  in wet or damp or hot locations where humidity or perspiration considerably
    reduces the skin resistance of the human body and the insulating properties of
    accessories.'
  - Environment with increased hazard of electric shock are not meant to include places
    where electrically conductive parts in the near vicinity of the operator which
    can cause the increased hazard have been insulated.
