data:
  definition: a multiport device in which the incident wave to any port is transmitted
    to the next port according to an order of sequence determined by the sense of
    a static magnetic biasing field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By reversing the magnetic biasing field, the order of sequence is reversed.
  - This property may be used to switch electromagnetic waves.
