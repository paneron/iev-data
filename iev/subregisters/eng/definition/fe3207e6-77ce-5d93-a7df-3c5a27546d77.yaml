    of this ratio
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bel may also be used to express the ratio of two field quantities. To obtain
    the same numerical value as for the corresponding power ratio, the logarithm of
    the field quantity ratio is multiplied by the factor 2, assuming that the impedances
    are equal.
  - This unit is not often used, having been superseded by the decibel.
