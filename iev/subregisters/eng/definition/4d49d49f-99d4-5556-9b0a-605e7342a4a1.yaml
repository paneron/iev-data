  definition: for a given point of an oriented curve with an origin point, real number,
    the absolute value of which is the length of the curve between the origin and
    the given point, and the sign is positive or negative depending on whether the
    path from the origin to the given point is consistent or not with the orientation
    of the curve
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a curve defined by the position vector stem:[r = f ( u )] as a function of
    the parameter stem:[u], with an origin O corresponding to stem:[u = 0], the abscissa
    of the point M corresponding to stem:[u] = stem:[u]~M~ is the line integral stem:[int_O^M
    | d r | = int_0^((u_M)) | ((d f))/((d u)) | d u].
  - In the usual geometrical space, the abscissa along a curve is a quantity of the
    dimension length.
