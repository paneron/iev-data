  notes:
  - 'Solder contacts may assume but are not limited to the following types:


    a) the wire is surrounded by the terminal, barrel, bucket, cup, well, etc.


    b) the wire surrounds the terminal: post, standoff, tag etc.


    c) the wire passes through the terminal: eyelet, hook, etc.


    d) no wire is involved, as in printed circuit applications: solder pinpost, SMT
    terminations (e.g. gull wings) spill, tail, etc.'
