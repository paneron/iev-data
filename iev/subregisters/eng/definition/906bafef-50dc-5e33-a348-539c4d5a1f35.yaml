  definition: 'for a square matrix *stem:[A]* of order stem:[n] with the elements
    stem:[Aij], scalar denoted by det *stem:[A]*, equal to the algebraic sum of the
    products obtained by taking as factors in all possible ways one and only one element
    from each row and each column, each product with the sign plus or minus depending
    whether the total number of inversions of the two subscripts is even or odd


    stem:[det A = underset(sigma)( sum ) ( - 1 )^(epsilon ( sigma )) A_((1 sigma (
    1 ))) A_((2 sigma ( 2 ))) ... A_((n sigma ( n )))]


    where stem:[σ] = (stem:[σ](1), stem:[σ](2), …, stem:[σ](stem:[n])) is a permutation
    of the subscripts (1, 2, …, stem:[n]), stem:[ε](stem:[σ]) is the number of inversions
    in permutation stem:[σ], and the sum denoted by Σ is for all permutations'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of the stem:[n] vectors,
    the coordinates of which are the elements of the rows or of the columns.
  - The determinant of the matrix stem:[A = ( [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1 n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((n
    1)),cdots,A_((n n))]] )] is denoted *stem:[A]* or stem:[| [[A_((11)),cdots,A_((1
    n))],[vdots,ddots,vdots],[A_((n 1)),cdots,A_((n n))]] |].
