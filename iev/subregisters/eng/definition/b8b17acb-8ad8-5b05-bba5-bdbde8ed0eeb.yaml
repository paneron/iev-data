  definition: in a set where a multiplication is defined, unique element stem:[u],
    if it exists, such that stem:[a * u = u * a = a] for any element stem:[a]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For numbers, the neutral element for multiplication is the number one, denoted
    by 1. For square matrices, it is the unit matrix of the same order. For quantities,
    the neutral element is a quantity of dimension one (or dimensionless quantity)
    whose numerical value is the number one. For {{dimensions of quantities, IEV:112-01-11}},
    the neutral element is the dimension of the quantities of dimension one, denoted
    by the symbol 1.
