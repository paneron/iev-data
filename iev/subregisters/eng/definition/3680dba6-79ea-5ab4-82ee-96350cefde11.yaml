  definition: a balun composed of two parallel, generally quarter-wavelength, conducting
    tubes, one end of which forms the balanced terminals and the other short-circuited;
    the unbalanced coaxial feed line passes through one of the tubes with its outer
    conductor being connected to that tube and the centre conductor connected to the
    other tube at the balanced terminals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Often, a quarter-wavelength sleeve encloses the balun, it being open at the balanced
    terminals and short-circuited to the tubes at the other end.
