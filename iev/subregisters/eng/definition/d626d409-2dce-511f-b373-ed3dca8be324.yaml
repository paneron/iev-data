  definition: 'law relating the illuminance, stem:[E]~v~, produced on a surface (which
    is normal to the direction of the light source and sufficiently distant for the
    light source to be considered as a <a href="IEV845-21-033">point source</a>) by
    a light source to the luminous intensity, stem:[I]~v~, of the light source in
    the direction of the surface, to the distance, stem:[d], between the surface and
    the light source, and to the atmospheric transmissivity, stem:[T], which is assumed
    to be uniform


    stem:[E_v = ((I_v))/((d^2)) T^(d // d_0)]


    where stem:[d]~0~ is the length specified in the definition of stem:[T]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The formula in the definition is sometimes written:


    stem:[E_v = ((I_v))/((d^2)) T^(delta)]


    where the exponent, stem:[δ], in stem:[Tδ] is the numerical value of the distance,
    stem:[d], measured with stem:[d]~0~ as "unit".'
  - 'Taking into account the relationship between atmospheric transmissivity, stem:[T],
    and <a href="IEV845-31-018">meteorological optical range</a>, stem:[v], given
    in Note 2 to entry of the definition of "meteorological optical range", Allard''s
    law can also be written as:


    stem:[E_v = ((I_v))/((d^2)) ( 0,05^(d // v) )].'
