  definition: modification of the visual response that occurs when two colour stimuli
    (of any spectral irradiance distribution) are viewed side-by-side, where each
    stimulus affects the appearance of the other
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Chromatic induction is virtually instantaneous, in contrast to chromatic adaptation
    which is considered to develop slowly in the visual system.
