  definition: a form of source coding combining differential pulse code modulation
    and other coding techniques
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A typical example is given by the combination of DPCM and PCM where the code words
    for the quantized difference between the actual sample value and the predicted
    value alternate in a prescribed succession with code words for the quantized signal
    value of the actual sample.
