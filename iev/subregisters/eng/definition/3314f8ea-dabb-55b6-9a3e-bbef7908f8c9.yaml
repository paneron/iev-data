  definition: a wave, which appears when an incident wave meets a surface separating
    two different media, which propagates away from the surface in the same medium
    as the incident wave, and which is interpretable by geometrical optics
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of transmission lines, the reflected wave is a wave deriving its energy
    from the direct wave and propagating in the opposite direction.
