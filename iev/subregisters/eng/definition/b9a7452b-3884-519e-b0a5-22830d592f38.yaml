  definition: production process of a superconducting thin film by mainly using physical
    evaporation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - PVD process mainly constitutes a thin film by using vacuum evaporation of atomic
    species or sputter deposition using single or multiple targets in inert or reactive
    atmospheres, e.g. ion beam sputtering.
