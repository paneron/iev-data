  definition: the reflection factor in the case of a plane wave, incident on an infinite
    planar surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term Fresnel reflection factor is only used for an incident wave, the electric
    flux density vector of which is either parallel to the surface or in the plane
    of incidence.
