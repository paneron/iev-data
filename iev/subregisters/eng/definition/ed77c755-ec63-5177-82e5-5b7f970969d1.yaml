  definition: quotient of the volume of a specified component and the sum of the volumes
    of all components of a gas mixture before mixing, all volumes referring to the
    pressure and the temperature of the gas mixture
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The volume fraction and volume concentration take the same value if, at the same
    state conditions, the sum of the component volumes before mixing and the volume
    of the mixture are equal. However, because the mixing of two or more gases at
    the same state conditions is usually accompanied by a slight contraction or, less
    frequently, a slight expansion, this is not generally the case.
