  definition: for a particle, its mass in an inertial frame where that particle has
    zero speed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 When the speed of the particle is negligible compared to the speed of light,
    the difference between mass and rest mass is also negligible.
  - 2 The rest mass of particle X is denoted stem:[m ( X)] or stem:[m]~X~; for example
    stem:[m]~e~ denotes the mass of electron.
