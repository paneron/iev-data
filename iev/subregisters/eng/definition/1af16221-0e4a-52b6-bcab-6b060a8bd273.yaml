  definition: 'density of radiant intensity with respect to projected area in a specified
    direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[L_e = ((d I_e))/((d A)) (1)/((cos alpha))]


    where stem:[I]~e~ is radiant intensity, stem:[A] is area, and stem:[α] is the
    angle between the normal to the surface at the specified point and the specified
    direction'

  notes:
  - 'In a practical sense, the definition of radiance can be thought of as dividing
    a real or imaginary surface into an infinite number of infinitesimally small surfaces
    which can be considered as <a href="IEV845-21-033"> point sources</a>, each of
    which has a specific radiant intensity, stem:[I]~e~, in the specified direction.
    The radiance of the surface is then the integral of these radiance elements over
    the whole surface.


    The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative
    (i.e. a rate of change of radiant intensity with projected area) and could alternatively
    be rewritten in terms of the average radiant intensity, stem:[bar I_e], as:


    stem:[L_e = underset((A -&gt; 0))((lim)) ((bar I_e))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))].


    Hence, radiance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities; the
    area, stem:[A], should be small enough so that uncertainties due to variations
    in radiant intensity within that area are negligible; otherwise, the quotient
    stem:[bar L_e = ((bar I_e))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))] gives the average radiance
    and the specific measurement conditions have to be reported with the result.'
  - For a surface being irradiated, an equivalent formula in terms of irradiance,
    stem:[E]~e~, and solid angle, stem:[Ω], is stem:[L_e = ((d E_e))/((d omega)) (1)/((cos
    theta))], where stem:[θ] is the angle between the normal to the surface being
    irradiated and the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source
    has no surface (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).
  - An equivalent formula is stem:[L_e = ((d Phi_e))/((d G))], where stem:[Φ]~e~ is
    radiant flux and stem:[G] is geometric extent.
  - 'Radiant flux can be obtained by integrating radiance over projected area, stem:[A]·cos
    stem:[α], and solid angle, stem:[Ω]: stem:[Phi_e = ​ ∬ L_e * cos alpha d A d omega].'
  - Since the <a href="IEV845-21-048">optical extent</a>, expressed by stem:[G·n]^2^,
    where stem:[G] is geometric extent and stem:[n] is refractive index, is invariant,
    the quantity expressed by stem:[L]~e~stem:[·n]^−2^ is also invariant along the
    path of the beam if the losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken
    as 0. That quantity is called "basic radiance".
  - 'The equation in the definition can also be described as a function of radiant
    flux, stem:[Φ]~e~. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second
    partial derivative of the radiant flux at a specified point (stem:[x], stem:[y])
    in space in a specified direction (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]) with respect to projected
    area, stem:[A]·cos stem:[α], and solid angle, stem:[Ω]:


    stem:[L_e ( x , y , vartheta , phi ) = ((del^2 Phi_e ( x , y , vartheta , phi
    )))/((del A ( x , y ) * cos alpha * del omega ( vartheta , phi )))]


    where stem:[α] is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point
    and the specified direction.'
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon radiance".
  - The radiance is expressed in watt per square metre per steradian (W·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
