  definition: 'vector field quantity stem:[*B*]  which exerts on any charged particle
    having velocity stem:[*v*] a force stem:[*F*]  equal to the product of the vector
    product stem:[*v*] x stem:[*B*]  and the electric charge  stem:[Q] of the particle:


    stem:[*F*] = stem:[Q*v*] x stem:[*B*]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The divergence of stem:[*B*]  is zero at all points:


    div stem:[*B*] = 0'
  - The magnetic flux density stem:[*B*] is sometimes called “magnetic field”, risking
    confusion with the magnetic field strength stem:[*H*] .
