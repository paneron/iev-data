  definition: "complex scalar, denoted by stem:[U * V^( * )], attributed to any pair\
    \ of vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* in a complex vector space by a given function,\
    \ with the following properties: \n\n* stem:[V * U^( * ) = ( U * V^( * ) )^( *\
    \ )],\n\n* stem:[( alpha U ) * V^( * ) = alpha ( U * V^( * ) )] and stem:[U *\
    \ ( beta V )^( * ) = beta^( * ) ( U * V^( * ) )] where stem:[α] and stem:[β] are\
    \ complex scalars, \n\n* stem:[( U + V ) * W^( * ) = U * W^( * ) + V * W^( * )]\
    \ for every vector *stem:[W]* existing in the same vector space, \n\n* stem:[U\
    \ * U^( * ) &gt; 0] for stem:[U != 0],\n\n\nwhere the asterisk denotes the conjugate\
    \ vector"

  notes:
  - 'In an stem:[n]-dimensional space with orthonormal base vectors the Hermitian
    product of two vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* is the sum of the products of
    each coordinate stem:[U_i]of the vector *stem:[U]* and the conjugate of the corresponding
    coordinate stem:[V_i] of the vector *stem:[V]*:


    stem:[U * V^( * ) = underset(i)( sum ) U_i V_i ^( * )]'
  - For two complex vectors or two complex vector quantities *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]*
    either the Hermitian product stem:[U * V^( * )] or a conjugate Hermitian product
    stem:[U^( * ) * V] may be used depending on the application. The Hermitian product
    stem:[U * U^( * )] or stem:[U^( * ) * U] is a real scalar or a real scalar quantity,
    respectively.
  - The Hermitian product is denoted by a half-high dot (·) between the two symbols
    representing one vector and the conjugate of the other.
