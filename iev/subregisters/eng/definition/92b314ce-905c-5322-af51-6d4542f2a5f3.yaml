  definition: simultaneous line sequential colour television system using, in baseband,
    a composite colour signal comprising a luminance signal and two chrominance components
    each of which is transmitted sequentially, as frequency modulation of a separate
    subcarrier. The receiver is provided with a line period delay line to permit the
    simultaneous display of the three colour components
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In most applications of SECAM, the scanning system uses 625 lines and 50 fields/second.
    The colour signal is transmitted using vestigial sideband amplitude modulation,
    and the sound is transmitted as amplitude or frequency modulation of a separate
    radio-frequency carrier.
  - SECAМ is derived from "Sequential Couleur à Мémоire".
  - There are different versions of SECAM defined in CCIR Report 624.
