    with which it is aligned.

    terms and definitions are obtained by replacing “standards” by “technical regulations”
    in the definitions {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}} to {{IEV 901-06-09, IEV:901-06-09}},
    and “standardizing bodies” by “authorities” in definition {{IEV 901-06-01, IEV:901-06-01}}.'
