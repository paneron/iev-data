  definition: a change of longitude, measured in the frame of reference defined by
    the primary body and the stars, of a characteristic point in a satellite orbit,
    such as the ascending node
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Precession of the orbit of a satellite is caused by a perturbation of its orbital
    motion, due for instance to non-uniformities in the distribution of mass in the
    primary body.
  - Precession of the orbit of a satellite should not be confused with precession
    of a rotating body.
