  definition: standard observer whose colour-matching functions deviate from those
    of the CIE standard colorimetric observer in a defined manner
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The defined deviations can be applied to the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer
    or the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric observer.
  - The use of the CIE standard deviate observer is intended to generate differences
    that are typical of those that occur when colour matches are made by different
    real observers whose colour vision is classified as normal.
  - 'See also CIE 80, _Special Metamerism Index: Change in Observer_.'
