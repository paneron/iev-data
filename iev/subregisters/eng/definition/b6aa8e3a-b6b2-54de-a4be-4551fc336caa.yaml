    1) by preheating the part to be coated to make powdered plastic particles in the
    fluidized bed adhere to it, or


    2) by dipping the part to be coated, which must be at least slightly electrically
    conductive and earthed, cold into a fluidized bed of electrostatically charged
    powdered plastic particles and subsequently fuse  the adhering particles to it
