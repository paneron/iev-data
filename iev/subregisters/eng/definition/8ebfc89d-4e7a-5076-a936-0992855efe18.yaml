  definition: 'stem:[p_c = ((L_d))/((L_n + L_d))]


    where stem:[L]~d~ and stem:[L]~n~ are the respective luminances of the monochromatic
    stimulus and of the specified achromatic stimulus that match the colour stimulus
    considered in an additive mixture'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of purple stimuli, the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    whose chromaticity is represented by a point on the purple boundary.
  - In the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system, colorimetric purity, stem:[p]~c~,
    is related to excitation purity, stem:[p]~e~, by the equation stem:[p]~c~Â = stem:[p]~e~stem:[y]~d~/stem:[y]
    where stem:[y]~d~ and stem:[y] are the stem:[y] chromaticity coordinates respectively,
    of the monochromatic stimulus and the colour stimulus considered.
  - In the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric system, a measure, stem:[p]~c,10~, is defined
    by the relation given in Note 2 to entry, but using stem:[p]~e,10~, stem:[y]~d,10~
    and stem:[y]~10~ instead of stem:[p]~e~, stem:[y]~d~, and stem:[y] respectively.
