  definition: closed-loop control, able to keep system properties within a prescribed
    area even if the properties of the controlled system or the properties of the
    controller deviate from those assumed for the design of the control system by
    not more than a predetermined amount.
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Properties of the control system may be its stability, the damping ratio of its
    transfer function, or the overshoot of its unit-step response.
  - Properties of the controlled system or the controller e.g. can deviate because
    disturbances, delays or dead times have not been taken into consideration, parameters
    are influenced by variable operating conditions, or the controller has been implemented
    in a non-ideal way.
  - Phase margin or gain margin may be used to describe the robustness of a control
    loop.
