  definition: '1 – the increase in the cross-section of a beam with increasing distance
    from the source


    2 – in the far-field region, angle subtended by two diametrically opposed points
    in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis, at which points the irradiance is
    a specified fraction of the beam''s peak irradiance'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Generally, only the maximum and minimum divergences (corresponding to the major
    and minor diameters of the far-field irradiance) need be specified.
