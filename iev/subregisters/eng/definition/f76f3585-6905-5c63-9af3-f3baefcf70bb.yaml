  definition: magnitude of the angular velocity *stem:[ω]* divided by the angle 2π,
    thus stem:[n] = |*stem:[ω]*|/2π
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The rotational frequency is also the derivative of the absolute value of angle
    of rotation stem:[φ] with respect to time stem:[t], divided by 2π, thus stem:[n
    = (1)/((2 pi)) ((d | phi |))/((d t))].
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of rotational frequency is second to the power minus one,
    s^–1^. The units revolution per second, symbol r/s, and revolution per minute,
    symbol r/min, are widely used in specifications for rotating machines.
