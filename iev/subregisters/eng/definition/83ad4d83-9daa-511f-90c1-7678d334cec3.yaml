  definition: a form of spread spectrum modulation in which the carrier frequency
    is automatically changed at short intervals, selection being made in a pseudo-random
    way from a set of frequencies covering a frequency band much wider than the bandwidth
    required for the information to be transmitted
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The rate at which the frequency is changed may be faster or slower than the bit
    rate of the information signal.
