  notes:
  - For optical fibres intrinsic absorption components consist of tails of the ultraviolet
    and infrared absorption bands, and extrinsic components include impurities (e.g.
    the OH-ion and transition metal ions) and defects (e.g. the results of thermal
    history and exposure to nuclear radiation).
