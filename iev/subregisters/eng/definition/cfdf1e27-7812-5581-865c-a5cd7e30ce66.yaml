  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:705-01-13}} of a {{linearly polarized, IEV:726-04-08}}
    wave for which the {{electric field strength, IEV:121-11-18}} at a given point
    in space is normal to that of a reference linearly polarized wave of a different
    or of the same {{direction of propagation, IEV:103-10-05}}'
