  definition: 'relative change in permittivity due to a change in temperature divided
    by the change in temperature


    stem:[T C epsilon = ((epsilon_T – epsilon_((ref))))/((epsilon_((ref)) ( T – T_((ref))
    )))]


    where


    stem:[ε]~stem:[T]~ is the permittivity at temperature stem:[T];


    stem:[ε]~ref~ is the permittivity at reference temperature stem:[T]~ref~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The temperature coefficient of permittivity is generally expressed in megakelvins
    to the power minus one (1/MK).
