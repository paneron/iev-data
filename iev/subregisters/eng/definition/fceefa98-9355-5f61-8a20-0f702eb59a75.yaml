  definition: quotient of the total radiant flux of all wavelengths emitted by the
    fluorescent process for an excitation wavelength and the total radiant excitation
    power irradiating the <a href="IEV845-24-041">fluorescent material</a>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This quantity is also measured in relative terms by comparison to the radiant
    flux reflected from the perfect reflecting diffuser identically irradiated and
    viewed for a given excitation wavelength.
  - Fluorescence is understood to include both fluorescent and phosphorescent phenomena
    with time constants short enough to be ignored for the application.
  - The spectral external radiant efficiency of the fluorescent specimen has unit
    one.
