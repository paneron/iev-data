  definition: multiplexing in which several independent signals are allotted orthogonal
    signals for transmission over a common channel
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In code division multiplexing, the signal elements allotted to distinguish the
    channels are so shaped that they can be easily distinguished and separated by
    using an appropriate operation although they may overlap in time and frequency
    when transmitted over a common channel.
