  definition: '1. an increase between two points of an electric, electromagnetic,
    or acoustic power


    2. the quantitative expression of a power increase by the ratio of the values
    at two points of a power or of a quantity related to power in a well defined manner'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By extension, the word "gain" may represent the ratio of powers in a given situation
    and in a reference condition; for example the "gain of an antenna".
  - Gain is generally expressed in logarithmic units by a positive or negative value.
    When a gain has a negative value in logarithmic units, attenuation may be used
    instead of gain.
