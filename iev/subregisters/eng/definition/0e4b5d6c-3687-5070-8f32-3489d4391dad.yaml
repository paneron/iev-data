  definition: 'one of the two following quotients:


    a) for transduction of an electric signal into a mechanical signal, quotient of
    the resulting force in the blocked mechanical system by the excitation current
    in the electrical system;


    b) for transduction of a mechanical signal into an electric signal, quotient of
    the resulting open-circuit voltage in the electrical system by the excitation
    velocity in the mechanical system'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These definitions are best applied to a reciprocal electromechanical transducer
    with gyroscopic coupling, for example an electromagnetic transducer, in which
    case the two quotients have equal magnitude.
