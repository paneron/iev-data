  definition: a transformer in which the magnetic circuit takes the form of columns
    (legs)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Generally, core-type transformers incorporate concentric windings.
  - Since there are types of transformer which do not come clearly within the categories
    of "core-type" and "shell-type", the use of these terms is deprecated. Generally
    they can be avoided by indicating the type of windings, i.e. "concentric" or "sandwich",
    and/or whether or not the magnetic circuit has unwound magnetic return paths.
