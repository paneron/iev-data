data:
  definition: '1. the assembly, obtained by frequency division multiplexing of a specified
    number of FDM telephone channels, normally 12, in adjacent positions in a frequency
    band of specified width, constituting the first level in the standardized frequency
    division multiplex hierarchy


    2. a frequency band of standardized width, 48 kHz, in a multichannel carrier system
    and occupying one of a number of specified positions in the spectrum'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A group is normally an assembly of 12 FDM telephone channels, each of 4 kHz bandwidth.
    But in some systems, for example those systems used over submarine cables, a group
    is an assembly of 16 FDM telephone channels, each of 3 kHz bandwidth.
  - Signals, other than those derived from FDM telephone channels, may occupy the
    whole or a part of the frequency band normally assigned to a group.
