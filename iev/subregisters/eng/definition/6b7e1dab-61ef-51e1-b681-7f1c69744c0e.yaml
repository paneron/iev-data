  definition: real vector space or real point space for which a scalar product is
    defined for any two vectors
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The usual geometrical three-dimensional space is a Euclidean point space. Four-dimensional
    vectors used in special relativity are elements of a non-Euclidean point space
    because the scalar product of a vector by itself may be negative. Another example
    of non-Euclidean vector space is the set of stem:[n-]bit words formed of the digits
    zero and one with addition modulo two, because the scalar product of a vector
    by itself can be zero for a non-zero vector.
