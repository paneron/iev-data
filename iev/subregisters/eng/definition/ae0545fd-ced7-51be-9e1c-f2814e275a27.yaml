  definition: the second of a set of three orthogonal coordinate axes, called the
    roll, pitch and yaw axes, defined by convention for a spacecraft and used as a
    reference for locating elements of the spacecraft, for describing rotation of
    the spacecraft and for specifying the attitude of the spacecraft relative to a
    system of external coordinates
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a geostationary satellite the pitch axis is usually made approximately parallel
    to the Earth's polar axis.
