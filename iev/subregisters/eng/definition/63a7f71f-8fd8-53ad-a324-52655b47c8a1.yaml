  definition: in the field of nuclear fusion, a method of containing the fusible material
    within a limited volume
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This is achieved by an implosion in which the kinetic energy communicated to the
    centripetal fusible material is transformed into internal energy to obtain the
    conditions for ignition.
  - A series of many converging laser beams can achieve this confinement.
