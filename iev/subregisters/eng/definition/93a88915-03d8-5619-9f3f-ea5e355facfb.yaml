  definition: 'graphical representation in polar coordinates of the amplitude reflection
    factor stem:[r], for a lossless uniform transmission line with characteristic
    impedance stem:[Z]~0~:


    stem:[underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) - Z_0))/((underset(_)(Z) + Z_0)) = ((underset(_)(Z)
    // Z_0 - 1))/((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 + 1))]


    in terms of the complex impedance stem:[Z] by two families of orthogonal circles
    on each of which either the modulus stem:[Z] or the argument stem:[θ] has a constant
    value, where stem:[Z] = stem:[Z]/stem:[θ] is the complex impedance in the direction
    of propagation of the incident wave at the point at which the amplitude reflection
    factor is evaluated'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The stem:[Z]-Theta chart may be used with impedances stem:[Z], admittances stem:[underset(_)(Y)
    = (1)/(underset(_)(Z))], normalized impedances stem:[(underset(_)(Z))/((Z_0))]
    or normalized admittances stem:[(underset(_)(Y))/((Y_0)) = ((Z_0))/(underset(_)(Z))].
  - The stem:[Z]-Theta chart is usually restricted to values of stem:[θ] between stem:[-
    (pi)/(2)] and stem:[+ (pi)/(2)] corresponding to positive values of the real part
    of stem:[Z] in which case it is bounded by an outer circle where the magnitude
    of the amplitude reflection factor is unity.
  - The stem:[Z]-Theta chart has the same properties and applications as those of
    the Smith chart, but the complex impedance stem:[Z] is represented with two families
    of orthogonal circles on each of which either the modulus stem:[Z] either the
    argument stem:[θ] has a constant value instead of the real and imaginary parts
    stem:[R] and stem:[X] of stem:[Z] used for the Smith chart.
