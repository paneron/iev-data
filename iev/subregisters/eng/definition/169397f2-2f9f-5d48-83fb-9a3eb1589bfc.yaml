  definition: impedance of the input circuit measured between the input terminals
    under operating conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The impedance can be expressed in terms of admittance.
  - In certain instances, for example, sampling devices or self-balancing potentiometers,
    the impedance can be different according to the instant when it is determined,
    before, during or after the instant of measurement.
  - When the input circuit is such that the instantaneous value of the current flowing
    into the input terminals is a non-linear function of the instantaneous value of
    the input voltage under specified conditions of frequency and voltage, the combination
    of resistance and reactance which would absorb the same active power and in which
    would flow a reactive current equal to the fundamental component that is flowing
    in the actual input circuit, is sometimes called the "equivalent input impedance".
