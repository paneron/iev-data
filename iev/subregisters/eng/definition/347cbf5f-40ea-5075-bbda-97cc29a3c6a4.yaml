  notes:
  - 'Photoelectric transducers are divided into two groups according to their applications:
    1) a photodetector that handles light signals, and 2) a photovoltaic power system,
    such as a solar battery, that responds to light energy. In the former case, sensitivity
    and response speed are important, while in the latter case, energy conversion
    efficiency is important. Classified by their operating principles, photoelectric
    transducers can be divided into a photoconductive type, typified by {{photoconductive
    cells, IEV:521-04-33}} and image pick-up tubes, and a photovoltaic type, typified
    by {{photodiodes, IEV:521-04-32}} and solar batteries.'
