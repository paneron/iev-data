  definition: 'quotient of reflected radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~r~, and incident radiant
    flux, stem:[Φ]~m~


    stem:[rho = ((Phi_r))/((Phi_m))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Reflectance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case,
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, stem:[α] + stem:[ρ] + stem:[τ] = 1 except when <a
    href="IEV845-21-017">polarized radiation</a> is observed, where stem:[α] is absorptance
    and stem:[τ] is transmittance.
  - 'Reflectance, stem:[ρ], is the sum of regular reflectance, stem:[ρ]~r~, and diffuse
    reflectance, stem:[ρ]~d~: stem:[ρ] = stem:[ρ]~r~ + stem:[ρ]~d~.'
  - The reflectance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-58 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
