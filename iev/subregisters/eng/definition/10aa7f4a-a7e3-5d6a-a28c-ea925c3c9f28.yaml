  definition: "logarithm of the ratio of a given time integral of squared A-frequency\
    \ weighted sound pressure, over a stated time interval or event such as an aircraft\
    \ flyover, to the product of the squared reference sound pressure of 20 Î¼Pa and\
    \ the reference duration of one second. Sound exposure level in decibels is ten\
    \ times the logarithm to the base ten of that ratio. The reference\r\nsound pressure\
    \ and the frequency weighting may be different, if specifically stated with the\
    \ sound exposure level"
