data:
  definition: an effect caused at a signalling terminal when the two signalling channels
    in opposite directions in the same signalling link are not synchronized to each
    other, and in which there is not a one-to-one correspondence between transmitted
    and received signal units over a long period; additionally, where signal units
    are assembled into blocks, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between transmitted
    and received blocks
