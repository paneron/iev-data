data:
  definition: the value of the coercive field strength in a material when the magnetic
    flux density, magnetic polarization or magnetization is brought from saturation
    by a monotonically changing magnetic field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The parameter that is varied should be stated, and the appropriate symbol used
    as follows : stem:[H]~cstem:[B]~ for the coercivity relating to the flux density,
    stem:[H]~cstem:[J]~ for the coercivity relating to the polarization, stem:[H]~cstem:[M]~
    for the coercivity relating to the magnetization. The first two symbols supersede
    stem:[BH]~c~ and stem:[JH]~c~.'
