  definition: "qualifies in a point space:\n\n* a straight line with respect to a\
    \ coplanar straight line when they have no common point or when they are merged;\
    \ \n\n* a straight line with respect to a plane when the plane contains a line\
    \ parallel to the given line; \n\n* a plane with respect to another plane when\
    \ any line in one plane has a parallel line in the other plane"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Parallelism is an equivalence relation for two lines or for two planes.
  - Usual wordings for lines are "a line A is parallel to line B", or "lines A and
    B are parallel", or " A and B are parallel lines". Similar wordings are used for
    the other cases.
