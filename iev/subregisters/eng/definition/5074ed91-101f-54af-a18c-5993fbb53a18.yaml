  definition: voltage between the two terminals of a phase element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For star connection of a polyphase element which is connected to line conductors
    and to a neutral conductor, the phase-element voltages are equal to the line-to-neutral
    voltages.
  - For polygonal connection of a polyphase element which is connected to line conductors,
    the phase-element voltages are equal to the line-to-line voltages.
