data:
  definition: ionization chamber in which the wall materials and the filling gas have
    approximately the same effective atomic number as air
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The chamber may be used to determine the absorbed dose in air or the air kerma
    when it is calibrated against a free-air ionization chamber. The ionization produced
    inside the chamber is essentially the same as that which would be produced in
    air at the same point in the absence of the chamber.
