  definition: quotient of luminous flux and the corresponding radiant flux for a specified
    photometric condition
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The photometric condition should be specified (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic).
    If it is not specified, photopic vision is assumed and the symbol stem:[K] is
    used. For other photometric conditions, the respective symbol for identification
    shall be used.
  - 'Luminous efficacy of radiation for photopic vision is expressed by


    stem:[K = ((Phi_v))/(Phi_e)]


    where stem:[Φ]~v~ is luminous flux and stem:[Φ]~e~ is radiant flux.'
  - 'The value of the luminous efficacy of radiation for photopic vision for <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic
    radiation</a> of {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} stem:[ν]~cd~ = 540 × 10^12^ Hz is
    defined as 683 lm·W^−1^ and denoted as stem:[K]~cd~. The corresponding wavelength,
    stem:[lambda_((cd)) \ = n^(- 1) * c_((0)) * nu_(cd)^(- 1)] (where stem:[n] is
    refractive index and stem:[c]~0~ is the {{speed of light in vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}})
    in standard air, i.e. dry air at 15 °C and 101 325 Pa, containing 0,045 % of carbon
    dioxide by volume (see P.E. Ciddor: _Refractive index of air: new equations for
    the visible and near infrared, Appl. Opt. Vol 35, No. 9_, 1996, pp. 1566-1573),
    is accepted to be 555,017 nm (rounded from 555,017 069 nm). This is very close
    to 555 nm, the wavelength where stem:[V](stem:[λ]) reaches its maximum. For photometric
    measurements made in air under real environmental conditions, the influence of
    the variation of the refractive index on stem:[λ]~cd~ with respect to standard
    air is typically in the range of a few picometres and can be neglected in most
    cases.'

  - The luminous efficacy of radiation is expressed in lumen per watt (lm·W^−1^).
