  definition: series of complex coefficients obtained by the expansion in Fourier
    series of the AC magnetization stem:[M(t)]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The AC magnetization, stem:[M(t),] under the magnetic field strength of stem:[h_0
    cos omega t] is expanded as:


    stem:[M ( t ) = h_0 sum_((n = 0))^(oo) kappa_n^'' cos ( n omega t ) + kappa_n^″
    sin ( n omega t )]


    where stem:[kappa_n^''] and stem:[kappa_n^″] are the real and imaginary parts
    of the AC magnetic susceptibility for the order stem:[n].'
  - The fundamental components stem:[kappa_1^'] and stem:[kappa_1^″] are mostly observed
    for measurements of superconducting transition.
  - 'The AC loss energy density stem:[W] is given as:


    stem:[W = pi mu_0 h_0^2 kappa_1^″]'
