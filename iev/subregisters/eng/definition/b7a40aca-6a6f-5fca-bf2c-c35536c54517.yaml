  notes:
  - In English, the term "transmission channel" is well understood to imply unidirectional
    working only, and then is commonly abbreviated to "channel". To avoid confusion
    with this usage, the term "access channel", which encompasses bidirectional working
    through the user-network interface must not be abbreviated to "channel".
  - An "access channel" may be qualified, for example, by H, B or D, in which case
    it is appropriate to call it an H-channel, a B-channel or a D-channel.
