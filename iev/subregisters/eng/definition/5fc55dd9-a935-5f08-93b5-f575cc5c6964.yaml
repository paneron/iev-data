data:
  definition: electrical change that may be recorded in a part of the brain in response

    nerves, or in some point on the sensory pathway leading from the periphery to
    the centre

  notes:
  - The term "evoked potential" refers to the evoked slow wave events rather than
    to the cellular discharges that may be associated with them.
