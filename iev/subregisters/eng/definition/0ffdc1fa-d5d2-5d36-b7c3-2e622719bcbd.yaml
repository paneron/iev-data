  definition: ability of an electric power system to operate in such a way that credible
    events do not give rise to loss of load, stresses of system components beyond
    their ratings, bus voltages or system frequency outside tolerances, instability,
    voltage collapse, or cascading
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This ability may be measured by one or several appropriate indices.
  - This concept is normally applied to bulk power systems.
  - In North America, this concept is usually defined with reference to instability,
    voltage collapse and cascading only.
