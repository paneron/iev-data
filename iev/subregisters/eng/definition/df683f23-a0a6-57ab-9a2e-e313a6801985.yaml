        type: identical
  concept: ecf52512-3f5c-5acd-9bd5-61d1c11470de
  definition: dose equivalent at a point in a radiation field, produced by the corresponding
    aligned and expanded field, in the ICRU sphere at a depth stem:[d], on the radius
    opposing the direction of the aligned field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In defining these quantities, it is useful to stipulate certain radiation fields
    that are derived from the actual radiation field. The terms "expanded" and "aligned"
    are used to characterise these derived radiation fields. In the expanded field,
    the fluence and its angular and energy distribution have the same values throughout
    the volume of interest as in the actual field at the point of reference. In the
    aligned and expanded field, the fluence and its energy distribution are the same
    as in the expanded field but the fluence is unidirectional.
  - The ICRU sphere is a 30 cm diameter, tissue-equivalent sphere with a volumic mass
    of 1 g/cm3 and a mass composition of tissue equivalent material (see 393-14-78).
  - The recommended depth stem:[d], for environmental monitoring in terms of stem:[H]*(stem:[d])
    is 10 mm, and stem:[H]*(stem:[d]) may then be written as stem:[H]*(10).
  - An instrument that has an isotropic response and is calibrated in terms of stem:[H]*(stem:[d])
    will measure stem:[H]*(stem:[d]) in any radiation fields that are uniform over
    the dimensions of the instrument.
  - The definition of stem:[H]*(stem:[d]) requires the design of the instrument to
    take account of backscatter.
