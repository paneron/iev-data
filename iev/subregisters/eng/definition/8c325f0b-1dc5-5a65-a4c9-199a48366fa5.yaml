  definition: radiation detector which reveals optical defects produced by ionizing
    radiation in the material constituting the detector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For example, the track etch detector is a neutron radiation detector consisting
    of a light plastic material (e.g. CR39) in which the incoming radiation physically
    displace the nuclei of that material.
  - The observation of the tracks of the incoming particles by etching allows the
    establishment of a relationship between the number of tracks and incoming particle
    fluence.
