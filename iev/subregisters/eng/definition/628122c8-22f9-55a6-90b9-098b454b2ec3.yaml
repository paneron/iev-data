  definition: luminance of a comparison field in which radiation of {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}
    540 × 10^12^ Hz has the same brightness as the field considered under the specified
    photometric conditions of measurement, where the comparison field must have a
    specified size and shape which can be different from that of the field considered
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Radiation at a frequency of 540 × 10^12^ Hz has a wavelength in standard air of
    approximately 555,017 nm.
  - A comparison field can also be used in which the radiation has any <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative
    spectral distribution</a>, if the equivalent luminance of this field is known
    under the same conditions of measurement.
  - The equivalent luminance is expressed in candela per square metre (cd·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-58 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
