  definition: quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a> of
    radiance due to fluorescence at wavelength stem:[λ] and the sum of the tabulated
    values of this distribution across the fluorescence band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Fluorescence is understood to include both fluorescent and phosphorescent phenomena
    with time constants short enough to be ignored for the application.
  - 'The relative spectral fluorescence distribution, stem:[F](stem:[λ]), when multiplied
    by the spectral external radiant efficiency of the fluorescent specimen, stem:[Q],
    for excitation at wavelength, stem:[μ], gives the bispectral luminescent radiance
    factor, stem:[β]~L,~stem:[λ](stem:[μ]), of a <a href="IEV845-24-040">photoluminescent
    material</a> according to:


    stem:[β]~L,~stem:[λ](stem:[μ]) = stem:[F](stem:[λ])·stem:[Q](stem:[μ])'
  - The relative spectral fluorescence distribution has unit one.
