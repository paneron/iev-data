  definition: process whereby conduction occurs through the potential barrier of a
    PN junction and in which electrons pass in either direction between the conduction
    band in the N-region and the valence band in the P-region
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Tunnel action, unlike the diffusion of charge carriers, involves electrons only.
    The transit time is practically negligible.
