data:
  definition: width of a {{frequency band, IEV:103-09-01}} over which a given characteristic
    of the {{transmission channel, IEV:701-02-01}} does not differ from its {{reference
    value, IEV:311-07-01}} by more than a specified amount or ratio
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The given characteristic can be, for example, the {{amplitude/frequency characteristic,
    IEV:702-07-35}}, the {{phase/frequency characteristic, IEV:702-07-36}} or the
    {{delay/frequency characteristic, IEV:702-07-37}}.
