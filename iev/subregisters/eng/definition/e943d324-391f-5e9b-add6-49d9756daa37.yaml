data:
  definition: a condition that occurs when the directivity of an antenna significantly
    exceeds that obtained from an aperture of the same dimension as that of the actual
    antenna but with uniform aperture illumination or, in the case of an array, from
    the array with elements uniformly excited
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Most frequently superdirectivity can be obtained only when amplitude and phase
    of currents, or field on the aperture, vary rapidly over distances short compared
    to the wavelength, which may lead to a very poor efficiency and usually renders
    the use of this property impractical.
