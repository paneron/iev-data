  definition: one of the coordinates that is used to describe the position within
    a system, where stem:[i] = 1, 2, â€¦, stem:[N], and stem:[N] is the degree of freedom
    or lowest number of coordinates necessary to fully define the position
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The unit depends on the type of representation of the system. In mechanics, the
    generalized coordinates may be length or angle.
