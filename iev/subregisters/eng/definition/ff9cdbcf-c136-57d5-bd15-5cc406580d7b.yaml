  definition: at a given point in a transmission line or waveguide, the complex ratio
    of a specified field vector component in an electromagnetic wave in a given mode
    to the same field vector component in a reference wave in the same mode
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a mode of propagation, the reference wave may be one that carries unit power
    and in which a specified field component has zero phase at a specified point in
    the reference transverse cross-section. Usually, the transverse component of the
    electric field vector at the centre point of the reference cross-section is chosen
    for that purpose.
  - For an evanescent mode, the power carried by the wave is zero. One can then make
    the integral of the longitudinal complex Poynting vector, over the reference cross-section,
    equal to the imaginary unit, or use any other well-defined normalization.
  - It is preferable to consider separately the modes of propagation and the evanescent
    modes because the normalized complex wave amplitude concept is mostly applied
    to the former.
  - In rare cases where the scattering matrix has to be extended to evanescent modes,
    it is better to give the user freedom to choose and define his own reference waves.
