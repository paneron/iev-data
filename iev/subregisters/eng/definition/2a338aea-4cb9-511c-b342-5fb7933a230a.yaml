  definition: 'rate of photon number per time interval


    stem:[Phi_p = ((d N_p))/((d t))]


    where stem:[N]~p~ is photon number, transmitted or received, and stem:[t] is time'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Photon flux, stem:[Φ]~p~, is related to radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~e~, of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic
    radiation</a> by


    stem:[Phi_p = ((Phi_e))/((h nu))]


    where stem:[h] is the Planck constant, and stem:[ν] is the frequency of the corresponding
    electromagnetic wave.'
  - For a beam of radiation whose spectral distribution is stem:[((d Phi_e ( lambda
    )))/((d lambda))] or stem:[((d Phi_e ( nu )))/((d nu))], the photon flux can be
    expressed by stem:[Phi_p = int_0^(oo) ((d Phi_e ( lambda )))/((d lambda)) * (lambda)/((h
    c_0)) d lambda = int_0^(oo) ((d Phi_e ( nu )))/((d nu)) * (1)/((h nu)) d nu],
    where stem:[h] is Planck's constant and stem:[c]~0~ is the {{speed of light in
    vacuum, IEV:113-01-34}}.
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant flux". The corresponding photometric
    quantity is "luminous flux".
  - The photon flux is expressed in second to the power minus one (s^−1^).
