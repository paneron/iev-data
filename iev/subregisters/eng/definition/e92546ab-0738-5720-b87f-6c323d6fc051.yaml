  definition: a graphical representation of the distribution in space of a quantity
    which characterizes the electromagnetic field produced by an antenna
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For example, a radiation pattern may be a plot of the magnitude of a far field
    component, or alternatively contours of equal value of a far field component,
    at a given distance from the antenna, as a function of the direction.
  - In French, the term "diagramme de directivit√©" is the preferred term when the
    quantity used to characterize the field does not depend upon the power fed to
    the antenna.
