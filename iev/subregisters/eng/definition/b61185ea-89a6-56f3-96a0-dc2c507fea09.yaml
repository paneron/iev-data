        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: cacf40ab-08ee-5c39-afe2-580ff1e43460
  definition: 'quotient of the {{character mean entropy, IEV:171-07-28}} stem:[H]^′^
    by the mean duration of a character


    stem:[H]^*^ &amp;equals; stem:[H]^′^/stem:[t](stem:[X])


    where stem:[X] &amp;equals; {stem:[x]~1~, …, stem:[x]~stem:[n]~} is the set of
    input characters stem:[xi] (stem:[i] &amp;equals; 1, …, stem:[n]) and stem:[t
    ( X ) = sum_((n = 1))^n p ( x_i ) * t ( x_i )] is the mean value of the duration
    stem:[t](stem:[xi]) of a character stem:[xi] which occurs with probability stem:[p](stem:[xi])'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The average information rate can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon per
    character and second.
