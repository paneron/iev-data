  definition: a thin, dielectric or metallic film (or several such films) applied
    to an optical surface to reduce the reflectance and thereby increase the transmittance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ideal value of the refractive index of a single layered film is the square
    root of the product of the refractive indices on either side of the film, the
    ideal optical thickness being one quarter of a wavelength.
