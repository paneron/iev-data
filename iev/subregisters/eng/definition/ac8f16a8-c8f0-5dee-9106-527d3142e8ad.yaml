    is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the effective voltages
    of the spectral components of a disturbance induced in the channel or set, each
    voltage being weighted to take account of the corresponding frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For telephony, the conventional weighting is given in the CCITT Recommendation
