    of message recognized as erroneous'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Error correction makes use of either an {{error correcting code, IEV:702-05-20}}
    or an {{error detecting code, IEV:702-05-19}} or a {{loop checking, IEV:721-08-18}}
    with, in the last two cases, automatic repetition of the signals recognized as
    being erroneous.
