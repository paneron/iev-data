  definition: for two second-order tensors stem:[T = ( T_((i j)) )] and stem:[S =
    ( S_((k l)) )], tensor of the second order the components of which are given by
    stem:[(( T * S ))_((i l)) = underset(m)( sum ) T_((i m)) S_((m l))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The inner product is denoted by a half-high dot (Â·) between the two symbols representing
    the tensors.
