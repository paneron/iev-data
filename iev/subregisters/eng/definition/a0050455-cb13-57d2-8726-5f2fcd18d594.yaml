  definition: condition during which the equipment provides at least one {{secondary
    function, IEV:904-03-03}} but no {{primary function, IEV:904-03-02}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Depending on the equipment, the terms "standby mode" and "sleep mode" can describe
    a partial on mode.
  - 'Table 1 provides a structured overview as an aid to understanding this and other
    concepts relating to energy efficiency and power consumption applicable in electrotechnical
    products. Additional terms to fulfil the particular needs of particular product
    sectors should be defined within the structure of the concepts shown in Table
    1.


    *Table 1 â€“ Operating conditions of equipment in respect to power demand*


    <simg>


    As the number of functions increases from left to right in Table 1, the relevant
    modes will generally have higher energy consumption. The existence of a mode in
    Table 1 does not imply that a particular piece of equipment will offer that mode.</simg>'
