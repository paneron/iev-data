  definition: 'scalar or tensor quantity the product of which by the electric field
    strength stem:[*E*]  in a medium is equal to the electric flux density stem:[*D*]:


    stem:[*D*] = stem:[Îµ *E*]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an isotropic medium the permittivity is a scalar quantity; for an anisotropic
    medium it is a tensor quantity.
