  definition: the ratio of the two values of a random quantity characterizing the
    transmission which correspond to the same probability of exceeding these values
    with and without diversity reception
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The characteristic quantity may be, for instance, the received power, the transmission
    loss, the noise power, or the error ratio.
  - The order of the two values is chosen so as to obtain a ratio greater than one.
  - The diversity gain is generally expressed in decibels when the quantity is a power
    or a loss.
