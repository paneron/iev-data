data:
  definition: logarithmic ratio, expressed in decibels, of the available power of
    the given source to the power that the device delivers to a load impedance under
    specified operating conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Transducer attenuation is given by


    stem:[TL = 10 log ((P_a))/((P_L)) dB]


    where


    stem:[P]~a~ is the available power


    stem:[P]~L~ is the power that device delivers to a load impedance'
