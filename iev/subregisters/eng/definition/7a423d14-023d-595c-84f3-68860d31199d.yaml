  definition: 'the quotient of the energy dstem:[E] lost by a charged particle of
    specified energy in traversing a path length dstem:[l] in a material:


    stem:[S = ((d E))/((d l))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For energies at which nuclear interactions can be neglected, the total linear
    stoping power is the sum of the linear collision stopping power and the linear
    radiative stopping power.
