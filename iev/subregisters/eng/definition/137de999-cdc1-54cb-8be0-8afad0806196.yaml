  definition: 'law relating the illuminance, stem:[E], on a real or imaginary surface
    to the luminous intensity, stem:[I], of an illuminating <a href="IEV845-21-033">point
    source</a> whereby


    stem:[E = ((I cos theta))/((d^2))]


    where stem:[Î¸] is the angle between the normal to the surface and the line between
    the surface and the source and stem:[d] is the distance between the source and
    the surface'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The photometric distance law strictly only applies for a point source. However,
    it can also be applied for non-point sources at sufficiently large distances within
    acceptable limits of error or measurement uncertainty; in this case the degree
    of approximation at the distance used should be confirmed by measurement.
  - For radiometric sources the equivalent term is "radiometric distance law".
