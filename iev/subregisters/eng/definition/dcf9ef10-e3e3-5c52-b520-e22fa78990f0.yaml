data:
  definition: ionization chamber containing flat electrodes and an intervening additional
    electrode, called the Frisch grid, which is held at an intermediate potential,
    to reduce the influence of ions and to increase the efficiency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A grid ionization chamber is a pulse ionization chamber mainly used to measure
    the energy of alpha particles or fission fragments.
