  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the power available at
    the terminals of a receiving antenna from the desired electromagnetic wave, to
    the available power resulting from an undesired wave having the same field strength
    but differing by some other specified characteristic such as direction of propagation,
    polarization, signal frequency
