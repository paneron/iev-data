  definition: material which exhibits photoluminescence as the result of exposure
    to <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Photoluminescent materials absorb energy from optical radiation in the shorter
    wavelength regions of the visible spectrum and/or in the ultraviolet region and
    re-radiate some of this energy at longer wavelengths, producing narrow bands of
    emission in the visible region.

    fluorescent colour</a>".
