  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of natural
    convection and thermal conduction, defined by stem:[R a = ((l^3 rho^2 c_p g alpha_V
    Delta T))/((eta lambda)) = ((l^3 g alpha_V Delta T))/((nu alpha))], where stem:[l]
    is a specified length, stem:[ρ] is mass density, stem:[c]~stem:[p]~ is specific
    heat capacity at constant pressure, stem:[g] is acceleration of free fall, stem:[α]~stem:[v]~
    is the cubic expansion coefficient, stem:[T] is thermodynamic temperature, stem:[η]
    is dynamic viscosity, stem:[λ] is thermal conductivity, and stem:[α] is thermal
    diffusivity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Rayleigh number is the product of the Grashof number stem:[Gr] and the Prandtl
    number stem:[Pr], thus stem:[Ra] = stem:[Gr] ⋅ stem:[Pr].
