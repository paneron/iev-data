  definition: 'quotient of the <a href="IEV845-21-049">radiance</a> at a surface element
    of a medium in a given direction and the <a href="IEV845-21-053">irradiance</a>
    on the medium


    stem:[q_e = ((L_e))/((E_e))]


    where stem:[L]~e~ is radiance and stem:[E]~e~ is irradiance'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is similar to the
    radiance coefficient except that it is defined for directional incident radiation.
  - The radiance coefficient is expressed in steradian to the power minus one (sr^âˆ’1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-70 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
