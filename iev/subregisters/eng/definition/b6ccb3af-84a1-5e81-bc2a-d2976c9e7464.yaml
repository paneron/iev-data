data:
  definition: a pulse that has the waveform of a Gaussian distribution
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In the time domain, the waveform is :


    stem:[f(t)] = stem:[A] ехр [– (stem:[t] / stem:[a])^2^]


    where stem:[A] is a constant, and stem:[a] is the pulse half duration at the 1/e
    points.'
