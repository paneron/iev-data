  definition: the phase displacement between the fundamental components of the magnetic
    flux density and the magnetic field strength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Where a phase displacement can be associated with eddy currents, hysteresis or
    residual losses, the loss angle may be designated by stem:[δ]~F~ for eddy current
    loss, stem:[δ]~h~ for hysteresis loss and stem:[δ]~r~ for residual loss.
  - 'The tangent of loss angle is often used to express the losses in a magnetic material:


    stem:[tan delta_m = (mu^( ″ ))/(mu^( '' ))]


    where stem:[µ]′ and stem:[µ]″ are the real and imaginary components respectively
    of the complex permeability (symb.: stem:[µ]).'
