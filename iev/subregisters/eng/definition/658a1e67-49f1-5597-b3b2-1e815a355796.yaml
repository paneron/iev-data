  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the flow of fluids at the interface
    between two different fluids, defined by stem:[W e = ((rho v^2 l))/(sigma)], where
    stem:[ρ] is the difference of the mass densities of the fluids, stem:[v] is their
    relative speed, stem:[l] is a specified length, and stem:[σ] is surface tension
