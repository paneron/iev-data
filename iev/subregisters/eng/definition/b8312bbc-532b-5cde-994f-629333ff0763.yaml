  definition: ratio of the RMS value of the {{harmonic content, IEV:103-07-31}} of
    an alternating quantity to the RMS value of the quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When a {{reference fundamental component, IEV:103-07-20}} is defined, the term
    "total harmonic factor" is sometimes restricted to harmonic components only (see
    {{IEV 551-20-15, IEV:551-20-15}}), and the term "total distortion factor" is used
    for the concept defined here (see {{IEV 551-20-16, IEV:551-20-16}}).
