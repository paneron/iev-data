  definition: '{{polarization, IEV:485-15-01}} caused by slow diffusion to the reaction
    sites in the {{electrode, IEV:485-02-01}}, or slow diffusion of products from
    the electrodes of the {{fuel cell, IEV:485-08-01}}, or both'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Concentration polarization is more important at high current densities and can
    result in a sharp decrease in the cell voltage.
