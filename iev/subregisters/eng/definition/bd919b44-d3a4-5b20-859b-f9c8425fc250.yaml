  definition: for a plane surface S and a specified axis in the plane of the surface,
    additive scalar quantity equal to the integral stem:[I_a = int_S R^2 d A], where
    stem:[R] is the distance between a surface element with area dstem:[A] and the
    axis
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 The second axial moment of area is sometimes given the wrong name "moment of
    inertia" but should not to be confused with the quantity "moment of inertia".
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of second axial moment of area is metre to the power four,
    m^4^.
