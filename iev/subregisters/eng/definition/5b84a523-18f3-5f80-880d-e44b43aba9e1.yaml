  definition: effective radiance with the spectral radiance, stem:[Lλ], spectrally
    weighted with the retinal thermal hazard spectral weighting function, stem:[r](stem:[λ])
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The wavelength range for "retinal thermal radiance" is the "<a href="IEV845-26-048">retinal
    hazard spectral region</a>".
  - This definition is based on the assumption that an action spectrum is adopted
    for the effect considered, and that its maximum value is 1.
  - It is essential to specify which action spectrum is used, as the unit is the same
    for any action spectrum.
  - The retinal thermal radiance is expressed in watt per square metre per steradian
    (W·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
