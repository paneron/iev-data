  definition: "energy transmitted by ionizing radiation to the matter in a given volume\
    \ such that:\n\nstem:[ε] = stem:[R]~1~ – stem:[R]~2~ + ∑stem:[Q]\n\nwhere\n\n\
    \ *  stem:[R]~1~ is the radiant energy incident on the volume, i.e. the sum of\
    \ the energies, excluding rest energies, of all those directly and indirectly\
    \ ionizing particles which enter the volume, *  stem:[R]~2~ is the radiant energy\
    \ emerging from the volume, i.e. the sum of the energies, excluding rest energies,\
    \ of all those directly and indirectly ionizing particles which leave the volume,\
    \ and *  ∑stem:[Q] is the sum of all changes of the rest mass energy of atomic\
    \ nuclei and elementary particles in any nuclear transformations which occur in\
    \ the volume; a positive sign is used when the change is a decrease and a negative\
    \ sign when the change is an increase"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The energy imparted is a stochastic quantity, identical to the integral absorbed
    dose in that volume, and expressed in joules (J).
