  definition: '{{signal, IEV:171-01-03}} in which the characteristic carrying information
    is defined at any instant of a time interval'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A continuous-time signal can be a {{continuous-value signal, IEV:171-01-09}},
    and therefore an {{analogue signal, IEV:171-01-14}}, or a {{discrete-value signal,
    IEV:171-01-11}}, as a quantized signal.
