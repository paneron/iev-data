        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: 95364175-1f27-58da-81ef-a6ebb9527be8
  definition: 'logarithm of the reciprocal of the conditional probability stem:[p
    ( x | y )] of the event stem:[x] given the occurrence of the event stem:[y]


    stem:[I ( x | y ) = log (1)/((p ( x | y )))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The conditional information content is also the amount by which the {{joint information
    content, IEV:171-07-20}} of the two events exceeds the {{information content,
    IEV:171-07-14}} of the second: stem:[I ( x | y ) = I ( x , y ) - I ( y )].'
