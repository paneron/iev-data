  definition: 'functional unit that generates in closed-loop control the reference
    variable at its output from the command variable at its input


    SEE: Figure 2.




    EXAMPLE 2: A turbine wall temperature measuring device ensures that the turbine
    output power is varied at such a rate that the temperature difference between
    the various zones of the turbine wall does not exceed permissible values.'
  examples:
  - '1: Electronic ramp-function generator the output signal of which follows variations
    of the input signal only up to a maximum permissible rate of change. If the rate
    of change of the input signal exceeds the permissible limit, the output signal
    follows only at a preset maximum rate of change.'
  notes:
  - Reference-variable generating elements are in many cases used to prevent critical
    limit values of the reference variable, its derivatives or other process variables
    being exceeded.
