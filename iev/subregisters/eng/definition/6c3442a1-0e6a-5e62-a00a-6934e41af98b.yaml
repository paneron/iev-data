  definition: coefficient of heat transfer when heat exchange takes place between
    a body at thermodynamic temperature stem:[T]~s~ and its surroundings that are
    at a reference temperature stem:[T]~r~, thus stem:[h = (phi)/((| T_s - T_r |))],
    where stem:[φ] is density of heat flow rate
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coherent SI unit of surface coefficient of heat transfer is watt per square
    metre kelvin, W/m^2^∙K.
