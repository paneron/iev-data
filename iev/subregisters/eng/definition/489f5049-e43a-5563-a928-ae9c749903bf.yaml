data:
  definition: spectrophotometric mode of measurement, where a means of wavelength
    separation (monochromator, bandpass filters/wedge) precedes the sample and the
    total (reflected or transmitted plus fluoresced) radiant flux leaving the sample
    is measured by the detector at the stated monochromatic wavelength
