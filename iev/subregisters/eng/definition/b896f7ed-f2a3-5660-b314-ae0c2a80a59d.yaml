data:
  definition: creepage distance of an insulator divided by the r.m.s. value of the
    highest operating voltage across the insulator.
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition differs from that of specific creepage distance where the line-to-line
    value of the highest voltage for the equipment is used (for AC systems usually
    stem:[U]~m~/√3). For line-to-earth insulation, this definition will result in
    a value that is √3 times that given by the definition of specific creepage distance
    in IEC 60815 (1986).
  - For ‘stem:[U]~m~’ see IEV 604-03-01.
  - It is generally expressed in mm/kV
