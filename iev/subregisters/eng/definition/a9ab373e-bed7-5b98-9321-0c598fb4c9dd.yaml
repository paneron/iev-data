  definition: spectral internal absorptance of a layer of an absorbing material such
    that the path of the radiation is of dimension length, and under conditions in
    which the boundary of the material has no influence
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The unit of the quantity length has to be specified. If a new unit of length is
    used that is stem:[k] times the magnitude of the original one, then the value
    of stem:[alpha_(i ,o)^() ( lambda ) = 1 - tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )] will change
    to stem:[alpha^( ' )_(i ,o)^() ( lambda ) = 1 - tau_((i ,o)) ( lambda )^k].
  - The spectral absorptivity has unit one.
