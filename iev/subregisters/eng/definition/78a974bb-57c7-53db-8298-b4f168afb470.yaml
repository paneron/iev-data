data:
  definition: accumulation or depletion of electric charges at an electrode, resulting
    in a difference between the electrode potential with current flow, and the potential
    without current flow or equilibrium electrode potential
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'This entry was numbered 111-15-18 in IEC 60050-111:1996. It has been modified
    as follows: polarization is considered as a process and potential difference is
    the result of this process. It differs for this reason from 482-03-02 in IEC 60050-482:2004.'
