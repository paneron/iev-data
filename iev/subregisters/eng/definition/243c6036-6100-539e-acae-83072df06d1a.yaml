data:
  definition: semiconductor in which the Fermi level is situated in the energy gap
    away from the boundaries at a distance at least twice as great as the product
    of Boltzmann's constant and the thermodynamic temperature
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The charge carriers in a non-degenerate semiconductor are governed by Maxwell-Boltzmann
    statistics.
