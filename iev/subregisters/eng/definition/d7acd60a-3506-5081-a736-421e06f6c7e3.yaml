  definition: semiconductor diode that exhibits a fast transition from a high-impedance
    state to a low-resistance state and vice versa, depending on the DC bias voltage
    or current applied to the diode, thus representing at microwave frequencies a
    high or low impedance, respectively, which enables it to pass or interrupt microwave
    signals
