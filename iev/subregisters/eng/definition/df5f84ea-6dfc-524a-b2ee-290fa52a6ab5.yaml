  definition: '{{nano-object, IEV:511-01-07}} with one external dimension in the {{nanoscale,
    IEV:511-01-03}} and the two other external dimensions significantly larger'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The smallest external dimension is the thickness of the nanoplate.
  - The two significantly larger external dimensions are considered to differ from
    the nanoscale dimension by more than three times.
  - The larger external dimensions are not necessarily in the nanoscale.
