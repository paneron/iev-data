  definition: 'of a material saturated by a magnetostatic field, the complex permeability
    when it is subjected to an electromagnetic wave having a circularly polarized
    stem:[vec H] field component in the plane perpendicular to the magnetostatic field
    strength:


    stem:[μ]~+~ = stem:[μ]~r~ + stem:[κ]~r~


    stem:[μ]~−~ = stem:[μ]~r~ − stem:[κ]~r~


    where stem:[μ]~r~ and stem:[κ]~r~ are components of Polder''s tensor permeability'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The subscript of stem:[µ] corresponds to the sign in the mathematical expression;
    stem:[μ]~+~ is applicable where the stem:[vec H] field rotates counterclockwise
    as a function of time when seen in the direction of the applied magnetostatic
    field; stem:[μ]~−~ is applicable to the reverse rotation.
