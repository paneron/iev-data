data:
  definition: 'quotient of absorbed radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~a~, and incident radiant
    flux, stem:[Φ]~m~


    stem:[alpha = ((Phi_a))/((Phi_m))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The absorptance is also defined spectrally in terms of wavelength, in which case,
    "spectral" is added before the quantity name.
  - Due to energy conservation, stem:[α] + stem:[ρ] + stem:[τ] = 1 except when <a
    href="IEV845-21-017">polarized radiation</a> is observed, where stem:[ρ] is reflectance
    and stem:[τ] is transmittance.
  - The absorptance has unit one.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-75 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
