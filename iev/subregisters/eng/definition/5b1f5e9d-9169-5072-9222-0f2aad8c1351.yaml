  definition: footwear ensuring that a person standing on a conductive or dissipative
    floor has a resistance to earth low enough to ensure dissipation of electrostatic
    charges but high enough to reduce the risk of a hazardous electrical shock
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'See IEC 61340-4-3, _Electrostatics – Part 4-3: Standard test methods for specific
    applications – Footwear_, and IEC 61340-4-5, _Electrostatics – Part 4-5: Standard
    test methods for specific applications – Methods for characterizing the electrostatic
    protection of footwear and flooring in combination with a person_.'
  - Antistatic footwear as described in ISO 20345, _Personal protective equipment
