  definition: '{{angle modulation, IEV:702-06-30}} in which each {{significant condition,
    IEV:702-05-21}} in a modulating {{discretely timed signal, IEV:702-04-04}} is
    represented by a specified value of the difference between the {{phase, IEV:103-07-04}}
    of the {{modulated signal, IEV:702-06-05}} and the phase of the {{carrier, IEV:702-06-03}}
