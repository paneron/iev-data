data:
  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the available power from
    a specified source to the active power delivered to a load of given impedance
    after insertion of a given two port device between the source and the load
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the transducer loss is less than one, its decibel value
    is negative, and its converse or its opposite value in decibels called transducer
    gain may be used.
