    which have, to be influenced by the control

  notes:
  - 'The final controlled variable is a variable stemming from the control task. It
    has to be connected functionally with the controlled variable but needs not to
    be part of the control loop. In contrast to this the controlled variable always
    belongs to the control loop. In case of warranties it may be helpful to differentiate
    beween controlled variable and final controlled variable.


    Controlling the composition of a mixture by the final controlled variable, the
    mixture proportion may not be measured directly. It is depicted by a mixture proportion
    dependent property (for example density, clouding, electrical or thermal conductivity)
    which is used as the controlled variable.'
