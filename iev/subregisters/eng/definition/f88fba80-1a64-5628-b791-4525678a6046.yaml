  definition: distance of exposure from a lamp or lamp system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For lamp safety evaluations, the exposure distance is the nearest distance consistent
    with the application of the lamp or lamp system. For lamps radiating in all directions,
    the distance is measured from the centre of the filament or arc source. For reflector-type
    lamps, the distance is measured from the outside edge of the lens or the plane
    defining the end of the reflector in a lens-free reflector.
  - The exposure distance is expressed in metres (m).
