  definition: at a given point, the amplitude of a specified electromagnetic wave
    which has met convergence effects, divided by the amplitude of a wave which would
    have existed at the same point without these effects
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the specified wave is a wave reflected by a curved surface, the corresponding
    factor may be considered as a factor which multiplies the reflection factor of
    the reflecting surface assumed to be flat.
