  definition: 'strength of coupling between coupled resonators which is defined as
    the ratio of coupled energy to stored energy and can be obtained from two split
    resonance frequencies by


    stem:[k] = (stem:[f]~h~^2^ â€“ stem:[f]~l~^2^) / (stem:[f]~h~^2^ + stem:[f]~l~^2^)


    where


    stem:[f]~h~ is the higher resonance frequency and


    stem:[f]~l~ is the lower resonance frequency'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coupling is mainly made either magnetically or electrically which is called
    magnetic or electric coupling, respectively.
