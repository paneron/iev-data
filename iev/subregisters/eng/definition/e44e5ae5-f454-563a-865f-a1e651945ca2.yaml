  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[E]~col~ by the product of stem:[ρ] and dstem:[l],
    where dstem:[E]~col~ is the energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy
    by collisions in traversing the path length dstem:[l] in a material of density
    stem:[ρ] :


    stem:[((S_((col))))/(rho) = (1)/(rho) * (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_((col))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The energy losses included are those that produce excitation and ionization of
    atoms as well as those producing recoil atoms.
