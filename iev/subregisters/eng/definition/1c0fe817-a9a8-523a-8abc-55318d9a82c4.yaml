  definition: at each point, the path tangential to the direction of propagation of
    energy at this point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The concept of ray is the basis of the geometrical optics which, when applicable,
    permits the substitution of simple relationships for Maxwell's equations.
  - In some cases, several paths may exist between two points.
  - In an isotropic medium, the propagation path is a trajectory orthogonal to the
    wavefronts and the term "ray" is often defined as this trajectory. In an anisotropic
    medium, the trajectories orthogonal to the wave fronts do not always coincide
    with physical paths between a source and a receiving point and should not be called
    rays.
