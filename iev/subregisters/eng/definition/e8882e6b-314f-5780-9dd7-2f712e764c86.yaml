        type: modified
  concept: 88e3cdfa-c92a-584e-85a4-78347d565597
  definition: '{{rated value, IEV:151-16-08}} of the voltage assigned by the manufacturer
    to a component, device or equipment and to which operation and performance characteristics
    are referred'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Equipment may have more than one rated voltage value or may have a rated voltage
    range.
  - For three-phase {{power supply, IEV:151-13-75}}, the {{line-to-line voltage, IEV:195-05-01}}
    applies.
