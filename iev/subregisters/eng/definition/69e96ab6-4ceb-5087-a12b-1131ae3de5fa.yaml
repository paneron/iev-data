  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[E]~tr~/stem:[E]~stem:[N]~ by stem:[ρ] dstem:[l],
    where stem:[E]~stem:[N]~ is the energy of each particle (excluding rest energy),
    stem:[N] is the number of particles, and dstem:[E]~tr~/stem:[E]~stem:[N]~ is the
    fraction of incident particle energy that is transferred to kinetic energy of
    charged particles by interactions in traversing a distance dstem:[l] in the material
    of density stem:[ρ]


    stem:[((mu_((tr))))/(rho) = (1)/((E_N rho)) * ((d E_((tr))))/((d l))]'

  notes:
  - 'For a given monoenergetic radiation, the relationship between kerma (stem:[K])
    and energy fluence (stem:[Ψ]) may be written
