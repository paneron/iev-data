  definition: 'under sinusoidal conditions in a medium where the phasors <u>stem:[D]</u>,
    <u>stem:[E]</u> and <u>stem:[J]</u> representing respectively the electric flux
    density, the electric field strength and the electric current density are linearly
    related, complex quantity stem:[ε]~re~ defined by the relation


    stem:[epsilon_0 underset(_)(epsilon)_((re)) underset(_)(E) = underset(_)(D) +
    ((underset(_)(J)))/((j omega)) = underset(_)(D) - j ((gamma underset(_)(E)))/(omega)]


    where stem:[γ] is the conductivity of the medium, stem:[ω] the angular frequency
    and stem:[ε]~0~ the electric constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The effective complex relative permittivity is generally frequency dependent.
    For an isotropic medium the effective complex relative permittivity is a scalar;
    for an anisotropic medium it is a tensor.
  - 'The effective complex relative permittivity and the complex relative permittivity
    stem:[ε]~r~ are linked by the relation


    stem:[underset(_)(epsilon)_((re)) = underset(_)(epsilon)_r - ((j gamma ))/((epsilon_0
    omega))]


    In a conductive medium, including good conductors and imperfect dielectrics, the
    useful and measurable quantity is the effective complex relative permittivity.'
  - The negative of the imaginary part of the effective complex relative permittivity
    represents both dielectric losses and losses due to the conductivity, the part
    due to conductivity being represented by stem:[γ]/stem:[ε]~0~stem:[ω].
