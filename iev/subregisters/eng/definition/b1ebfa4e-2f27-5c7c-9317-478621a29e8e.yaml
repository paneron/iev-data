data:
  definition: 'an atmosphere in which the refractivity is determined by the equation:


    stem:[N (h)] = 315 exp (-0,136 stem:[h])


    where stem:[h] is the altitude in kilometres above sea-level'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Up to a height of 1 km, the reference atmosphere for refraction may in practice
    be regarded as identical to the standard radio atmosphere.
