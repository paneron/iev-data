  definition: 'scalar constant stem:[μ]~0~ linking the electromagnetic quantities
    and the mechanical quantities, obtained from the relation


    stem:[(F)/(l) = ((mu_0))/((2 pi)) * ((| I_1 I_2 |))/(d)]


    where stem:[F/l] is the magnitude of the lineic force between two straight parallel
    conductors of infinite length and negligible circular cross-section, placed at
    a distance stem:[d] apart in vacuum and carrying electric currents stem:[I]~1~
    and stem:[I]~2~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In vacuum, the product of the magnetic constant and the magnetic field strength
    stem:[*H*] is equal to the magnetic flux density stem:[*B*]:


    stem:[*B*] = stem:[μ]~0~stem:[*H*]'
  - 'The magnetic constant is related to the electric constant stem:[ε]~0~ and to
    the speed of light in vacuum stem:[c]~0~ by the relation


    stem:[μ]~0~stem:[ε]~0~stem:[c]~0~^2^ = 1'
  - 'The value of the magnetic constant is exactly equal to


    4π × 10^−7^ m kg s^−2^ A^−2^ = 1,256 637 061 4... μH/m'
