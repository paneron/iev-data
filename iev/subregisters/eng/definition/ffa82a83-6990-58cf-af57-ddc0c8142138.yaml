    radiation</a>

  notes:
  - Sometimes, the term "light" is also used in physics as a synonym of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical
    radiation</a>, covering the spectral range from 100 nm to 1 mm and sometimes even
    covering the X-ray spectral range. This misuse of the term ‘'light'' should be
    avoided.
