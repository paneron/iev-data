  definition: fictitious single span in which tension variations due to load or temperature
    changes are nearly the same as in the actual spans in a section
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The approximate value stem:[a]~c~ of the equivalent span is calculated from:


    stem:[a_c â‰ƒ sqrt(((sum a_i^3))/((sum a_i)))]


    where stem:[a]~stem:[i]~ is the length of the span stem:[i] in the section.'
