  definition: 'number quantifying the acidic or the alkaline character of a solution,
    equal to the negative of the decimal logarithm of ion activity stem:[a]~H+~ of
    the hydrogen cation H^+^


    pH = −10 lg stem:[a]~H+~'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "At about 25 °C aqueous solutions with:  *  pH &lt; 7 are acidic; *  pH = 7 are\
    \ neutral; *  pH &gt; 7 are alkaline. \n\nAt temperatures far from 25 °C the pH\
    \ of a neutral solution differs significantly from 7."
