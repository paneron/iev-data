  definition: 'quotient of dstem:[Q] by dstem:[m], where dstem:[Q] is the absolute
    value of the total charge of the ions of one sign produced in air when all the
    electrons and positrons liberated or created by photons in air of mass dm are
    completely stopped


    stem:[X] = dstem:[Q]/dstem:[m]'
