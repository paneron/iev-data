  definition: frequency at which the magnitude of a measured characteristic quantity
    has decreased to a specified fraction of its low-frequency value
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a transistor, the cut-off frequency usually applies to the small-signal short-circuit
    forward current transfer ratio for either the common-base or common-emitter configuration.
