data:
  definition: quotient of the total luminous flux of the luminaire, measured under

    of the individual luminous fluxes of the same lamp(s) when operated outside the
    luminaire with the same equipment, under specified conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For luminaires using incandescent lamps only, the optical light output ratio and
    the light output ratio are the same in practice.
  - The light output ratio has unit one.
