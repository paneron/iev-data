  definition: 'quotient of the luminous intensity, stem:[I], of the retroreflector
    in the direction of observation and the illuminance, stem:[E_( _|_ )], at the
    retroreflector on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident light


    stem:[R = (I)/((E_( _|_ )))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coefficient of luminous intensity is expressed in candela per lux (cd·lx^−1^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-96 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
