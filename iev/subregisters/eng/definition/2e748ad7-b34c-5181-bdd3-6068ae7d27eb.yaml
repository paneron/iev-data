  definition: coupling between electric circuit elements, by which an electric current
    in one of them gives rise to a linked flux between the terminals of another element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In electromagnetism, the inductive coupling can be defined as the magnetic interaction
    by which a current linkage in a closed path gives rise to a magnetic flux through
    any surface bounded by another closed path.
