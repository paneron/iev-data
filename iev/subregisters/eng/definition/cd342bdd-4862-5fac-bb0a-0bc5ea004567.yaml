  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,



    . for stem:[n] quantities stem:[x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n], by the reciprocal of the
    mean value of their reciprocals:


    stem:[(1)/((X_h)) = (1)/(n) ( (1)/((x_1)) + (1)/((x_2)) + ... + (1)/((x_n)) )]
    if none of the stem:[n] quantities is equal to zero;


    stem:[X_h = 0] if at least one quantity is equal to zero;


    .  for a quantity stem:[x] depending on a variable stem:[t], by the quantity stem:[X_h]
    defined by the reciprocal of the mean value of the reciprocal of the given quantity:


    stem:[(1)/((X_h)) = (1)/(T) int_( 0)^( T) (1)/((x ( t ))) d t] if the value of
    the integral is finite;


    stem:[X_h = 0] in other cases'

  notes:
  - The harmonic mean value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The harmonic mean value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript h to
    the symbol of the quantity.
