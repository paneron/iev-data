data:
  definition: power dissipated in a composite superconductor due to application of
    a time-varying magnetic field or electric current
  examples: []
  notes:
  - AC loss includes time average hysteresis loss of the superconductor, a coupling
    current loss and an eddy current loss of the conductor, and an eddy current loss
    of the structural material.
  - AC loss customarily also includes the power dissipated in a composite superconductor
    due to application of transient changes in magnetic field or current.
