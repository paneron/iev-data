  definition: method of error control using a cyclic code mainly for the purpose of
    error detection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The bits of a data block to be protected are used as coefficients of a polynomial,
    which is modulo-2-divided by a prescribed generator polynomial; the coefficients
    of the remainder left after division are appended to the data block as a block
    check sequence.
