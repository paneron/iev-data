  definition: 'for a vector field *stem:[U]* that is given at each point of a surface
    S limited by an oriented closed curve C, theorem stating that the surface integral
    over S of the rotation of the field *stem:[U]* is equal to the circulation of
    this field along the curve C


    stem:[underset(S)( âˆ¬ ) rot U * e_n d A = underset(C)( oint ) U * d r]


    where *stem:[e]*~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface element and d*stem:[r]* is
    the vector line element'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The orientation of the surface S with respect to the curve C is chosen such that,
    at any point of C, the vector line element, the unit vector normal to S and defining
    its orientation, and the unit vector normal to these two vectors and oriented
    towards the exterior of the curve, form a right-handed or a left-handed trihedron
    according to space orientation.
  - The Stokes theorem can be generalized to the stem:[n]-dimensional Euclidean space.
  - In magnetostatics, the Stokes theorem is applied to express that the magnetic
    flux through the surface S is equal to the circulation over C of the magnetic
    vector potential. This circulation defines the linked flux. See {{IEV 121-11-24,
    IEV:121-11-24}}.
