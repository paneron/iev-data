data:
  definition: highest frequency at which a radio wave undergoes reflection in an ionospheric
    layer on which it is incident vertically
  examples: []
  notes:
  - There is usually one critical frequency for each magneto-ionic component
  - The critical frequency for the ordinary wave is the plasma frequency corresponding
    to the maximum electron density of the layer.
  - 'The critical frequencies for the ordinary wave and the extraordinary wave are
    respectively represented by the symbols stem:[f]~o~ and stem:[f]~x~, followed
    by the designation of the layer, for example: stem:[f]~o~F2.'
