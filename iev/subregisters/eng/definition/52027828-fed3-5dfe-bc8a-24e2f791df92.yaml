data:
  definition: a polyphase motor in which the rotor carries two windings, one of the
    windings receiving current from the supply by means of slip-rings while the other
    is connected to a commutator. The commutator carries two adjustable sets of brushes
    and supplies each of the separate phases on the stator with adjustable voltages,
    in order to attain a variation of speed and of the reactive power taken from the
    supply
