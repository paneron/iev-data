  definition: "operation, usually denoted by the plus symbol +, performed on a set\
    \ and assigning a unique element stem:[a] + stem:[b] of the set to any elements\
    \ stem:[a] and stem:[b] of the set, with the following properties:\n\n\n\n* associativity:\
    \ stem:[a] + (stem:[b] + stem:[c]) = (stem:[a] + stem:[b]) + stem:[c], where stem:[c]\
    \ is also an element of the set, \n\n* commutativity: stem:[a] + stem:[b] = stem:[b]\
    \ + stem:[a]"

  notes:
  - An addition is defined for natural numbers and extended to other classes of numbers
    and to mathematical entities such as vectors and matrices, and also to quantities
    of the same kind. An addition may be defined even for a finite set, for example
    the set of two elements 0 and 1 with addition modulo 2, i.e. 1 + 1 = 0.
  - The addition of entities stem:[a] and stem:[b] is expressed by the words "stem:[a]
    plus stem:[b]". The symbol Î£ is used to denote successive additions, for example
    stem:[a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_7] is denoted by stem:[sum_((i = 2))^7 a_i].
