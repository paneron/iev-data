  definition: quantity characterizing the variation with thermodynamic temperature
    stem:[T] of the volume stem:[V] of a body, under given conditions, thus stem:[alpha_V
    = (1)/(V) ((d V))/((d T))]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 1 When relevant, e.g. for a gas, the pressure should be given.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of cubic expansion coefficient is kelvin to the power minus
    one, K^âˆ’1^.
