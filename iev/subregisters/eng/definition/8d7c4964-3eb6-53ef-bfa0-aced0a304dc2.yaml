data:
  definition: fundamental law of electricity, stating that the voltage at the terminals
    of an ideal resistor is proportional to the current in the resistor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a linear two-terminal network under sinusoidal conditions, a generalization
    of Ohm law states that the phasors representing voltage and electric current are
    proportional.
