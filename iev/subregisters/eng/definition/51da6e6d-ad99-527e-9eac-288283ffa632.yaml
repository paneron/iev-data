  definition: electric current density at the critical current using either the cross-section
    of the whole conductor (overall) or of the non-stabilizer part of the conductor
    if there is a stabilizer
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The overall current density is called engineering current density (symbol: stem:[J]~e~).'
