  definition: probability that a given maintenance action, performed under stated
    conditions and using specified procedures and resources, can be completed within
    the time interval (stem:[t]~1~, stem:[t]~2~) given that the action started at
    stem:[t] = 0
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When stem:[t]~1~ = 0 and stem:[t]~2~ = stem:[t], then stem:[M](0, stem:[t]) is
    denoted simply as stem:[M](stem:[t]) and termed the maintainability function.
  - See also maintainability &lt;of an item&gt; ({{192-01-27, IEV:192-01-27}}).
