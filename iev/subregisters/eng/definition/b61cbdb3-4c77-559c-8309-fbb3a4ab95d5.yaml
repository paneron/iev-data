  definition: 'quotient of the luminance, stem:[L], of a plane retroreflective surface
    in the direction of observation and the illuminance, stem:[E_( _|_ )], at the
    retroreflector on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident light


    stem:[R_L = (L)/((E_( _|_ )))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coefficient of retroreflected luminance is particularly suitable for describing
    materials in sheet form.
  - The coefficient of retroreflected luminance is expressed in candela per square
    metre per lux (cd·m^−2^·lx^−1^).
