      modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: '{{probability, IEV:103-08-02}} that a {{data element, IEV:171-02-01}}
    is incorrectly received'
  examples:
  - Error probability for binary digits or bit error probability, stem:[P]~b~ or stem:[P]~bit~;
    block error probability, stem:[P]~bl~.
  notes:
  - The measured value is designated as "{{error ratio, IEV:702-07-39}}", whereas
    "error rate" is deprecated; for example, {{bit error ratio, IEV:704-18-04}} (BER);
    {{block error ratio, IEV:721-08-13}}.
