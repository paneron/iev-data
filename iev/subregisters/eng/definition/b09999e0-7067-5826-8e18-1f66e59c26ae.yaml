  definition: 'macroscopic quantum effect in which, when a voltage stem:[U] is applied
    across a Josephson junction, an alternating current of Cooper pairs flows by tunnelling
    through the junction, generating the emission of electromagnetic radiation having
    a frequency stem:[f] proportional to the applied voltage:


    stem:[f] = stem:[K]~j~stem:[U]


    where stem:[K]~j~ = 2stem:[e]/stem:[h] is the Josephson constant, with stem:[e]
    being the elementary electric charge and stem:[h] the Planck constant'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The alternating-current Josephson effect also manifests itself conversely so that,
    when a Josephson junction is irradiated by electromagnetic radiation of frequency
    stem:[f], the voltage across it can assume quantized values equal to stem:[nf]/stem:[K]~j~,
    where stem:[n] is a positive integer.
  - The value of the Josephson constant is 483 597,891(12) Ã— 10^9^ Hz V^-1^ (CODATA,
    2006).
