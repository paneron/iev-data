  definition: 'quotient of radiant energy and photon energy


    stem:[N_p = ((Q_e))/((h nu))]


    where stem:[Q]~e~ is radiant energy, stem:[h] is the Planck constant, and stem:[ν]
    is the {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} of the corresponding electromagnetic wave'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Photon number can also be expressed by the time integral of the photon flux,
    stem:[Φ]~p~, over a given duration, Δstem:[t]:


    stem:[N_p = int_((Delta t)) Phi_p d t]'
  - The photon number has unit one.
