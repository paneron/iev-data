  definition: ratio of the effective radius of the Earth to the actual Earth radius
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'This factor stem:[k] is related to the vertical gradient dstem:[n]/dstem:[h]
    of the refractive index n and to the actual Earth radius stem:[a] by the equation:


    stem:[k = (1)/((1 + a ((d n))/((d h))))]'
  - For an atmosphere having a standard refractivity gradient the value of stem:[k]
    is taken as 4/3, corresponding to an effective radius of the Earth of approximately
    8Â 500 km.
