  definition: '{{distribution, IEV:103-01-03}} assigning to any function stem:[f](stem:[x]),
    continuous for stem:[x = 0], the value stem:[f](0)'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Dirac function can be considered as the limit of a function, equal to zero
    outside a small interval containing the origin, and the integral of which remains
    equal to unity when this interval tends to zero. See FigureÂ 2, where instead of
    a triangle any other shape with area 1 is possible, too.
  - The Dirac function is the derivative of the unit step function considered as a
    distribution.
  - 'The Dirac function can be defined for any value stem:[x]~0~ of the variable stem:[x].
    The usual notation is:


    stem:[f ( x_0 ) = int_( - oo)^( + oo) delta ( x - x_0 ) f ( x ) d x]
