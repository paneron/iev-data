  definition: a four-port device intended to distribute the power fed into any one
    port equally between two other ports, transferring minimum power, ideally zero,
    to the fourth port
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ideal distribution of power usually requires that all ports be terminated
    with matched impedances, the differential coupler being then said to be "balanced".
  - A differential coupler may be used to combine two signals incident on two ports
    and feeding a single output port.
