  definition: "function stem:[f] that attributes a scalar stem:[f ( U , V )] to any\
    \ pair of vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]* in a given vector space, with the\
    \ following properties:\n\n\n\n* stem:[f ( alpha U , V ) = alpha f ( U , V )]\
    \ and stem:[f ( U , beta V ) = beta f ( U , V )] where stem:[α] and stem:[β] are\
    \ scalars, \n\n* stem:[f ( U + V , W ) = f ( U , W ) + f ( V , W )] and stem:[f\
    \ ( W , U + V ) = f ( W , U ) + f ( W , V )] for any vector *stem:[W]* existing\
    \ in the same vector space"
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A bilinear form over an stem:[n]-dimensional vector space can be represented by
    a square matrix stem:[( k_((i j)) )] and the scalar is stem:[f ( U , V ) = underset((i
    j))( sum ) k_((i j)) U_i V_j].
  - The bilinear forms over a given stem:[n]-dimensional vector space constitute an
    stem:[n^2]-dimensional vector space.
  - The concept of bilinear form extends to "linear form" in the case of one vector
    and to "multilinear form" (or stem:[m]-linear form) in the case of an ordered
    set of stem:[m] vectors.
