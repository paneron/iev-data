  definition: curve giving the cut-off current as a function of the prospective current,
    under stated conditions of operation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of alternating currents, the values of the cut-off currents are the
    maximum values which can be reached whatever the degree of asymmetry. In the case
    of direct currents, the values of the cut-off currents are the maximum values
    reached related to the time constant as specified.
