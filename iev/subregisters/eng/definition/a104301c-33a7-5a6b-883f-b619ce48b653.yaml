  definition: 'for a passive linear two-terminal element of two-terminal circuit with
    terminals A and B under sinusoidal conditions, quotient of the phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)]
    representing the electric current in the element or circuit by the phasor stem:[(underset(_)(U))_((A
    B))] representing the voltage ({{131-11-56, IEV:131-11-56}}) between the terminals


    stem:[underset(_)(Y) = ((underset(_)(I)))/(((underset(_)(U))_((A B))))]


    where the sinusoidal electric current represented by the phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)]
    is taken positive if its direction is from A to B or negative if its direction
    is from B to A and where the sinusoidal voltage stem:[u_((AB)) = v_A - v_B] represented
    by the phasor stem:[(underset(_)(U))_((A B))] is the difference of the electric
    potentials at terminals stem:[v_A] at A and stem:[v_A] at B'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The admittance of an element or circuit is the inverse of its impedance. It is
    equal to stem:[v_B], where stem:[G] is conductance for alternating current, stem:[B]
    is susceptance, stem:[Y] is apparent admittance, and stem:[Ï†] is displacement
    angle.
  - The coherent SI unit of admittance is siemens, S.
