data:
  definition: the measurement of the dielectric loss of insulation at predetermined
    values of temperature, frequency, and voltage or dielectric stress
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The dielectric loss is expressed in terms of the tangent of the complement of
    the insulation power-factor angle.
