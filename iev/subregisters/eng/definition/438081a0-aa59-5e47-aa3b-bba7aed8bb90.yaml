  definition: in a given direction, the ratio of the available power at the terminals
    of a receiving antenna to the power flux density of a plane wave of specified
    polarization incident on the antenna from that direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction corresponding to maximum available
    power is implied.
  - 'In free space, for a given polarization and direction, the partial effective
    area stem:[A]~ep~ of an antenna used for reception is related to the partial gain
    stem:[G]~p~ of the same antenna used for transmission, by the equation:


    stem:[G_p = ((4 pi A_((ep))))/((lambda^2))]


    where stem:[Î»] is the wavelength.'
