  definition: massive superconductor with large enough size except wires, tapes and
    thin films
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This superconductor is often used as a superconducting quasi-permanent magnet
    with trapped magnetic flux, and its size is typically larger than 10 mm in a larger
    dimension.
  - Bulk superconductor with trapped magnetic flux is used as permanent magnet for
    levitated system, water purification system, etc.
