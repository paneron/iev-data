data:
  definition: derivative of the generalized coordinate stem:[qi] with respect to time
    stem:[t], thus stem:[overset(Ë™)(q)_i = d q_i // d t]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The unit depends on the type of representation of the system. In mechanics, the
    generalized velocity may be speed or angular velocity.
