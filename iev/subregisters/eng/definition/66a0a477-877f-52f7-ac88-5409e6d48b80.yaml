  definition: a waveguide structure, usually of circular cross-section, whose propagation
    medium provides that the direction of polarization, that is, that of the electric
    field vector, for a linearly polarized wave is rotated clockwise in one direction
    of propagation and anti-clockwise in the other direction, in both cases as seen
    in the direction of propagation
