  definition: 'symbolic notation expressed formally as a vector, used to denote scalar
    or vector differential operators operating at each point of a given space region
    on scalars or vectors, and which, in orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, is represented
    by


    stem:[grad = e_x ( del )/((del x)) + e_y ( del )/((del y)) + e_z ( del )/((del
    z))]


    where stem:[e_x , e_y , e_z] are unit vectors along the stem:[x], stem:[y], stem:[z]
    axes'
