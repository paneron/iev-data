  definition: technique producing output data which are calculated by an algorithm
    using input data and a key as a parameter
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Even if the output data are known, it is impossible within a reasonable time to
    calculate the input data without knowledge of the key. It is also impossible within
    a reasonable time to derive the key from the output data, even if the input data
    are known.
