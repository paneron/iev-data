  definition: intermediate impurity level close to the conduction band in an extrinsic
    semiconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The donor level is filled at the temperature of zero kelvin; at any other temperature
    it can supply electrons to the conduction band. The donor levels can form narrow
    impurity bands.
