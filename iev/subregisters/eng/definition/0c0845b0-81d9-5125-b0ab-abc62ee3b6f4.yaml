  definition: the specified electromagnetic disturbance level used as a reference
    level for co-ordination in the setting of emission and immunity limits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By convention, the compatibility level is chosen so that there is only a small
    probability that it will be exceeded by the actual disturbance level. However
    electromagnetic compatibility is achieved only if emission and immunity levels
    are controlled such that, at each location, the disturbance level resulting from
    the cumulative emissions is lower than the immunity level for each device, equipment
    and system situated at this same location.
  - The compatibility level may be phenomenon, time or location dependent.
