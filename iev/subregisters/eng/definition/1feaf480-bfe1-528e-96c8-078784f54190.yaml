data:
  definition: time interval between the instants at which the magnitude of the pulse
    at the output terminals reaches specified upper and lower limits respectively
    when a semiconductor device is being switched from its conducting to its non-conducting
    state
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The upper and lower limits are usually 90 % and 10 % respectively of the initial
    amplitude of the output pulse.
