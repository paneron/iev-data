  definition: 'quotient of the relative change of saturation magnetization due to
    a change in temperature by that change in temperature


    stem:[alpha_((M s)) = ((M_((s Theta)) - M_((sref))))/((M_((sref)) ( Theta - Theta_((ref))
    )))]


    where stem:[M]~sstem:[Θ]~ and stem:[M]~sref~ are the saturation magnetizations
    at temperatures of stem:[Θ] and stem:[Θ]~ref~ respectively'
