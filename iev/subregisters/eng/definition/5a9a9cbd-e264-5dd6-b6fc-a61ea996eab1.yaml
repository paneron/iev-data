  concept: cbe928d0-932e-5c32-af54-88c919624ac9
  definition: capacitance measured at a frequency well above any pronounced resonance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, the value of the capacitance is often indirectly determined, because
    a direct measurement is affected by the presence of factors such as lead inductance.
  - This entry was numbered 561-02-35 in IEC 60050-561:1991.
