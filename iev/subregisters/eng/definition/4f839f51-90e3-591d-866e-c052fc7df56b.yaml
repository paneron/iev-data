  definition: mean value of irradiance on the outer curved surface of a very small
    (real or imaginary) cylinder that is oriented vertically at a point in space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Cylindrical irradiance is sometimes also defined as arithmetic mean of the vertical
    irradiance stem:[E]~e,v~ at a point


    stem:[E_((e ,c)) = (1)/((2 pi)) int_0^((2 pi)) E_((e ,v)) d phi]


    where stem:[E]~e,v~ is the vertical irradiance for an area element with its normal
    in the direction stem:[φ], and stem:[φ] is the angle in the plane perpendicular
    to the axis of the cylinder.'
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "cylindrical illuminance". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon cylindrical irradiance".
  - The cylindrical irradiance is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
