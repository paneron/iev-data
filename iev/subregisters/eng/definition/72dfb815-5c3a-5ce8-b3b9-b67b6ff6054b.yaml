  definition: sum of Sabine absorptions due to objects and surfaces in a room, and
    due to dissipation of energy in the medium within the room
  examples: []
  notes:
  - With stem:[A]~stem:[i]~ as the Sabine absorption of the stem:[i]-th surface or
    object or medium in a room, room absorption is stem:[A] = Σ stem:[A]~stem:[i]~.
  - 'Sabine absorption due to dissipation in the medium, in a room of volume stem:[V],
    is:


    stem:[A_m = (4)/((1 0 l o g_((10)) e)) alpha V = 0,921 alpha V]


    where:


    stem:[α] is the attenuation coefficient of the medium in decibels per unit length.'
