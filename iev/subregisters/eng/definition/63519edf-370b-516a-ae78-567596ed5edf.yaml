  definition: 'symbolic representation of the actions in a system by functional blocks,
    summing points and branching points linked by action lines


    SEE: Figures 1 and 2.'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The action lines do not necessarily represent physical connections, like electrical
    wires.
  - Functional blocks, action lines, summing points, and branching points are elements
    of the functional diagram.
