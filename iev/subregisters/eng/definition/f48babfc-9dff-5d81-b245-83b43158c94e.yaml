  definition: 'for an inductive two-terminal element with terminals A and B, derivative
    of the linked flux stem:[Î¨] between the terminals with respect to the electric
    current stem:[i] in the element:


    stem:[L_d = ((d Psi))/((d i))]


    where the sign of the linked flux is determined by taking the voltage, in the
    time integral defining it, as the difference of the electric potentials at A and
    B, and where the current is taken as positive if its direction is from A to B
    and negative in the opposite case'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For an ideal inductor, the differential inductance stem:[L]~d~ is equal to its
    inductance stem:[L].
