  definition: quantity relating to the difference in luminance between two surfaces
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "Widely accepted definitions include:\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n\
    \n* stem:[C] = (stem:[L]~1~ − stem:[L]~2~)/stem:[L]~1~ with stem:[L]~1~ &gt; stem:[L]~2~\
    \ (positive contrast),\n\n* stem:[C] = (stem:[L]~1~ − stem:[L]~2~)/stem:[L]~1~\
    \ with stem:[L]~1~ &lt; stem:[L]~2~ (negative contrast), \n\n* stem:[C] = (stem:[L]~1~\
    \ − stem:[L]~2~)/(stem:[L]~1~ + stem:[L]~2~) with stem:[L]~1~ &gt; stem:[L]~2~,\
    \ \n\n\n\nwhere stem:[C] is the luminance contrast and stem:[L]~1~ and stem:[L]~2~\
    \ are the luminances of the two surfaces."
  - Although luminance contrast is intended to correlate with brightness contrast,
    it is possible that it does not do so directly because brightness contrast depends
    on other factors such as the angular separation, the luminance gradient, and any
    size difference between the two surfaces.
