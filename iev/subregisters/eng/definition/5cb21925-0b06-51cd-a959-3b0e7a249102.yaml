  definition: interharmonic component having harmonic order lower then one
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Sub-harmonic components occur only when a harmonic order is defined in relation
    to the reference fundamental frequency not identical to the fundamental frequency.
  - In some applications, sub-harmonic components are restricted to orders being reciprocal
    of integers.
