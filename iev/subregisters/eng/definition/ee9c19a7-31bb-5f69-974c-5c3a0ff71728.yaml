  definition: a circulator providing a junction between transmission lines
  examples: []
  notes:
  - "Junction circulators may be built in several ways characterized by the symmetry\
    \ of the junction. To denote these circulator types, the word \"junction\" is\
    \ usually omitted and a qualifying prefix used instead. Examples of this practice\
    \ are the terms \"Y-circulator\" and \"T-circulator\", where the capitals are\
    \ used to describe the type of junction employed.\r\nIn the case of waveguide\
    \ junction circulators, further qualification may be needed, for example as illustrated\
    \ by the term \"H-plane Y-circulator\". Such qualifying prefixes should conform\
    \ with normal waveguide terminology."
