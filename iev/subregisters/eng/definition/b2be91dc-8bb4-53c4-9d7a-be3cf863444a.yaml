  definition: geometric mean of the cut-off frequencies limiting a single pass band
    or single stop band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, the arithmetic mean is often used as a good approximation to the
    geometric mean for piezoelectric filters with relatively narrow pass bands or
    stop bands.
