data:
  definition: 'the disaccommodation of permeability after magnetic conditioning divided
    by the logarithm (to the base of 10) of the ratio of the time intervals between
    the cessation of that conditioning and the second and first measurement respectively:


    stem:[d = (D)/((lg ((t_2))/((t_1))))]


    where, in this context, stem:[D] is the disaccommodation measured over the interval
    between stem:[t]~1~ and stem:[t]~2~ after magnetic conditioning'
