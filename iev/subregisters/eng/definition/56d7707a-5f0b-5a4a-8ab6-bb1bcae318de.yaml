  definition: for a time-dependent quantity, positive square root of the mean value
    of the square of the quantity taken over a given time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The root-mean-square value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - For a sinusoidal quantity stem:[a ( t ) = hat A cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )],
    the root-mean-square value is stem:[A_((eff)) = hat A // sqrt(2)].
  - The root-mean-square value of a quantity may be denoted by adding one of the subscripts
    eff or rms to the symbol of the quantity.
  - In electrical technology, the root-mean-square values of electric current stem:[i
    ( t )] and voltage stem:[u ( t )] are usually denoted stem:[I] and stem:[U], respectively.
  - The abbreviation RMS was formerly denoted as r.m.s. or rms, but these notations
    are now deprecated.
