data:
  definition: the product of the magnetic flux density and magnetic field strength
    of a permanent magnet at any point of any demagnetization curve
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The maximum value attained on the demagnetization curve is denoted (stem:[BH])~max~.
  - The stem:[BH] product is equal to twice the total energy stored in the external
    field of the magnet per unit volume of the magnet.
