data:
  definition: numerical value of the Celsius temperature expressed in degrees Celsius
    at which the estimated time to endpoint of an insulating material is the same
    as the estimated time to endpoint of a control material at a temperature equal
    to its assessed thermal endurance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The numerical value of the assessed thermal endurance temperature is equal to
    the assessed thermal endurance index (ATE).
  - Control material is a material with known thermal endurance, preferably derived
    from service experience, used as a reference for comparative tests with a candidate
    material.
