  definition: neutron of kinetic energy greater than the cadmium cut-off energy
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The cut-off energy, for a given experimental configuration, is determined by the
    condition that, if a cadmium cover surrounding a detector were replaced by a fictitious
    cover opaque to neutrons with energy below this value and transparent to neutrons
    with energy above this value, the observed detector response would be unchanged.
