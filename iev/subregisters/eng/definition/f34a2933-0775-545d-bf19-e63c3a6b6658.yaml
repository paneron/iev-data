  definition: qualifying a time-varying phenomenon, a {{timescale, IEV:702-04-11}}
    or a {{signal, IEV:101-12-02}}, the consecutive {{significant instants, IEV:721-02-29}}
    of which are separated by {{time intervals, IEV:113-01-10}} that all have the
    same rated {{duration, IEV:113-01-13}} or have rated durations equal to integral
    multiples of a unit duration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In practice, variations of the time intervals are constrained between specified
    limits.
