  definition: 'in an optical fibre a dimensionless quantity, denoted by stem:[V],
    given by


    stem:[V = ((2 pi a))/(lambda) ( n_1^2 - n_2^2 )^(1 // 2)]


    where:


    stem:[a] is the fibre core radius,


    stem:[Î»] is wavelength in vacuum, and


    stem:[n]~1~ and stem:[n]~2~ are the maximum refractive index in the core and refractive
    index of the innermost homogenous cladding, respectively'
