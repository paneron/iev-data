  definition: macroscopic quantum effect, occurring at low temperature in a two-dimensional
    system of high-mobility electrons or holes, in which an applied magnetic field
    induces between two points a voltage, the quotient of which by the electric current
    through a line joining the two points assumes, over certain high-value ranges
    of the magnetic flux density, quantized plateau values equal to stem:[R]~K~/stem:[n],
    where stem:[R]~K~ = stem:[h]/stem:[e]^2^ is the von Klitzing constant and stem:[n]
    an integer, stem:[h] being the Planck constant and stem:[e] the elementary electric
    charge
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quotient of the voltage by the electric current is called Hall resistance.
    The value of the von Klitzing constant is 25 812,807 557(18) Î© (CODATA, 2006).
