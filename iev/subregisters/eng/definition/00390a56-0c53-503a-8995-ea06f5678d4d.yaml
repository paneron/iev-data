  definition: 'technique that combines etching with corrosive gas and {{sputtering,
    IEV:521-03-17}} with ions


    Note 1 to entry: Under reactive ion etching, material is removed selectively in
    the vertical direction under the mask by both chemical reaction and physical bombardment
    (sputtering) with ions and radicals produced in plasma. Unlike in anisotropic
    etching wherein the direction of erosion depends on the crystal orientation of
    the material, in reactive ion etching the direction of removal is determined by
    the direction of the ion stream. Reactive ion etching results in less undercut
    erosion from the edge beneath the mask than does wet etching.
