  notes:
  - Microchannels are often used in fluidic {{devices, IEV:151-11-20}} such as a {{lab-on-a-chip,
    IEV:523-08-05}}. The flow in a microchannel is different from that in a macroscopic
    one, and the formulation of the flow is one of the key issues in micro-science
    and engineering. A microchannel can be used as an acoustic guide.
