  definition: a type of linear distortion occurring when the phase/frequency characteristic
    of a transmission line or two-port device deviates from the ideal form over the
    useful frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ideal form of the phase/frequency characteristic is a straight line for which
    the zero-frequency intercept on the phase axis is zero or an integral multiple
    of Ï€ radians.
  - The phase/frequency distortion differs from group delay/frequency distortion by
    the addition of a constant phase angle to all significant spectral components
    of the signal. If the zero-frequency phase intercept is an integral multiple of
    radians, this addition does not change the signal, or only reverses its sign.
