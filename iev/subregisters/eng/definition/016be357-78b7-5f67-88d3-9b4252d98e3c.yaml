  definition: 'graphical representation in polar coordinates of the amplitude reflection
    factor stem:[r] for a lossless uniform transmission line with characteristic impedance
    stem:[Z]~0~:


    stem:[underset(_)(r) = ((underset(_)(Z) - Z_0))/((underset(_)(Z) + Z_0)) = ((underset(_)(Z)
    // Z_0 - 1))/((underset(_)(Z) // Z_0 + 1))]


    in terms of the complex impedance stem:[Z] by two families of orthogonal circles
    on each of which either the resistance stem:[R] or the reactance stem:[X] has
    a constant value, where stem:[Z] = stem:[R] + jstem:[X] is the complex impedance
    in the direction of propagation of the incident wave at the point at which the
    amplitude reflection factor is evaluated'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The Smith chart may be used with impedances stem:[Z], admittances stem:[underset(_)(Y)
    = (1)/(underset(_)(Z))], normalized impedances stem:[(underset(_)(Z))/((Z_0))]
    or normalized admittances stem:[(underset(_)(Y))/((Y_0)) = ((Z_0))/(underset(_)(Z))]
  - The Smith chart is usually restricted to positive values of stem:[R], in which
    case it is bounded by an outer circle where the magnitude of the amplitude reflection
    factor is unity.
  - The Smith chart allows the conversion by direct reading of the amplitude reflection
    factor into the real and imaginary parts of the impedance or admittance and vice
    versa; the representation also simplifies the transformation of impedance or admittance
    from one point to another on the same transmission line.
