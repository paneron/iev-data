  definition: 'time integral of the cylindrical irradiance, stem:[E]~e,c~, at a given
    point for a given direction, over a given duration, Δstem:[t]


    stem:[H_((e,c)) = underset((Delta t))( int ) E_(e,c) d t]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The radiant cylindrical exposure is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^ =
    W·s·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-46 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
