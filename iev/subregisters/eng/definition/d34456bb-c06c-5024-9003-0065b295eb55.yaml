  definition: representation of a sinusoidal {{integral quantity, IEV:131-11-01}}
    by a complex quantity whose argument is equal to the initial phase and whose modulus
    is equal to the {{RMS value, IEV:103-02-03}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a quantity stem:[a ( t ) = hat A cos ( omega t + vartheta_0 )] the phasor
    is stem:[underset(_)(A) = A exp ( j vartheta_0 )], where stem:[A = (hat A)/((sqrt(2)))]
    is the RMS value and stem:[vartheta_0] is the initial phase. A phasor can also
    be represented graphically.
  - Electric current phasor stem:[underset(_)(I)] and voltage phasor stem:[underset(_)(U)]
    are often used.
  - The similar representation with the modulus equal to the amplitude is sometimes
    also called "phasor".
