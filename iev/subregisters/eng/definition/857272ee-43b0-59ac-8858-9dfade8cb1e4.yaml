  definition: AC voltage the r.m.s. value of which does not exceed 50 V or ripple-free
    DC voltage the value of which does not exceed 120 V, between conductors, or between
    any conductor and reference earth, in an electric circuit which  has galvanic
    separation from the supplying electric power system by such means as a separate-winding  transformer
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Maximum voltage lower than 50 V AC or 120 V ripple-free DC may be specified in
    particular requirements, especially when direct contact with live parts is allowed.
  - The voltage limit should not be exceeded at any load between full load and no-load
    when the source is a safety isolating transformer.
  - Ripple-free qualifies conventionally an r.m.s. ripple voltage not more than 10
    % of the DC component; the maximum peak value does not exceed 140 V for a nominal
    120 V ripple-free DC system and 70 V for a nominal 60 V ripple-free DC system.
