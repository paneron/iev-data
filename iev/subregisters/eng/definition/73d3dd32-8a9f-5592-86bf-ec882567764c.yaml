  definition: '{{sensor, IEV:151-13-48}} that uses organic substances in the {{device,
    IEV:151-11-20}}, that is intended for measurement of organism-related subsystems,
    or that mimics an organism'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A typical biosensor consists of a biologically originated specific material such
    as an enzyme or an antibody that identifies the object of measurement and the
    device that measures a physical or chemical quantity change related to the identifying
    reaction. A {{semiconductor, IEV:521-02-01}} sensor or any of various types of
    {{electrode, IEV:151-13-01}} (e.g. {{ISFET, IEV:523-04-03}}, micro-oxygen electrode,
    and fluorescence detection optical sensor) prepared by silicon micromachining
    technology can be used as this device. Biosensors are used for blood analysis
    systems, glucose sensors, microrobots, and so on.
