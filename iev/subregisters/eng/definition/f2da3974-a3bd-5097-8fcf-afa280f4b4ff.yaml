  definition: theorem that provides a criterion for the stability of the superconducting
    magnet to account for the temperature dependence of the heat-transfer coefficient
    and the thermal conductions along the wire and between adjacent turns in a coil
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This theorem is the basis for the Maddock's stability criterion, and states that
    a normal region formed by a disturbance will recover provided the area below the
    temperature-dependent cooling curve is greater than the area below the heat-generation
    curve.
