  definition: 'ratio of the product of ion molality stem:[b] and a correction factor
    stem:[γ] to the molality stem:[b]° of the same ion in a standard solution under
    standardized conditions


    stem:[a] = stem:[bγ] / stem:[b]°'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The correction factor is called activity coefficient and it is determined experimentally.
  - Normally a standard solution is a solution of the ion at a molality of 1 mol/kg
    (exactly). Standardized conditions are normally 1 013,25 hPa and 25 °C.
