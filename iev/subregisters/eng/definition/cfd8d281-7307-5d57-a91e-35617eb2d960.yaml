  definition: "{{modulation, IEV:701-03-08}} by a {{discretely timed signal, IEV:702-04-04}}\
    \ in which there is a predetermined relationship between the instants characterizing\
    \ the {{carrier, IEV:702-06-03}} phase prior to modulation and the {{significant\
    \ instants, IEV:721-02-29}} of the {{modulated signal, IEV:702-06-05}}\n\nEXAMPLE\t\
    Modulation in which the significant instants  of the modulated signal coincide\
    \ with zero crossings of the carrier."
