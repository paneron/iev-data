  examples: []
  notes:
  - A thin film is a film formed on a substrate by means of vacuum deposition or ion
    {{sputtering, IEV:521-03-17}}, or similar processes. The film thickness ranges
    from a layer of single atoms or molecules, to 5 µm in thickness. Usually the term
    "thin film technology" refers to films of a thickness of 1 µm or less. A thin
    film can change properties such as colour, reflectivity, and friction coefficient
    of the substrate, while the shape of the substrate is left practically unchanged.
    Phenomena such as optical interference and surface diffusion are noticeably affected
    by the formation of thin films. Thin film formations usually take a nonequilibrium,
    heterogeneous nuclear formation step, which brings on structural properties different
    from those of bulk materials produced under ordinary equilibrium conditions. In
    one application, thin film technology combined with etching improved the degree
    of integration of a thermal printer head that was conventionally manufactured
    by {{thick film technology, IEV:523-05-01}}.
