data:
  definition: wave which occurs in a medium when an incident wave propagating in this
    medium encounters one or more obstacles, possibly limiting openings, and which
    is not interpretable by geometric optics
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A diffracted wave may exist in regions which, according to the interpretation
    of geometric optics, are not reached by the incident wave or by reflected or refracted
    waves.
