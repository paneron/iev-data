  definition: 'quotient of the flux reflected in the directions delimited by a given
    cone with apex at a surface element, stem:[Φ]~n~, and the flux reflected in the
    same directions by a perfect reflecting diffuser identically irradiated or illuminated,
    stem:[Φ]~d~


    stem:[R = ((Phi_n))/((Phi_d))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition holds for a surface element, for the part of the reflected radiation
    contained in a given cone with apex at the surface element, and for incident radiation
    of given spectral composition, polarization and geometric distribution.
  - The reflectance factor is also defined spectrally and is called spectral reflectance
    factor, stem:[R](stem:[λ]).
  - The ideal isotropic (Lambertian) diffuser with reflectance or transmittance equal
    to 1 is called a perfect diffuser.
  - For regularly reflecting surfaces that are irradiated or illuminated by a beam
    of small solid angle, the reflectance factor can be much larger than 1 if the
    cone includes the mirror image of the source.
  - If the solid angle of the cone approaches 2π sr, the reflectance factor approaches
    the reflectance for the same conditions of irradiation.
  - If the solid angle of the cone approaches 0 sr, the reflectance factor approaches
    the radiance factor or luminance factor for the same conditions of irradiation.
  - The reflectance factor has unit one.
