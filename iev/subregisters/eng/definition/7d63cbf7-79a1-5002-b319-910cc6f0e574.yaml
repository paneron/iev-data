  definition: imaginary part stem:[g](stem:[t]) of an {{analytic signal, IEV:702-04-52}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The name "quadrature signal" is justified by the fact that, apart from sign changes,
    sin stem:[ωt] and cos stem:[ωt] are Hilbert transforms of each other and that
    consequently the analytic signal corresponding to the real signal cos stem:[ωt]
    is:


    e^jstem:[ωt]^'
