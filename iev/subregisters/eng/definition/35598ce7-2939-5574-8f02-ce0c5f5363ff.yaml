  concept: b574989a-ed85-58fe-8a98-438a0d7deabb
  definition: lower flammable limit (LFL) and upper flammable limit (UFL), stated
    in percent by volume or in g/m^3^ of gas in a gas-air mixture, between which a
    flammable mixture is formed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the past, "flammable" and "explosive" have been used interchangeably in many
    texts, but the trend is to avoid the confusion that this causes. The term "flammable"
    relates to the properties of the material that determine its ability to produce
    self-sustaining flame propagation in any direction (upwards, sideways or downwards).
    The term "explosive" relates to flame propagation that is accompanied by pressure
    and temperature rise and noise (usually higher-speed propagation) and is significantly
    affected by (non-material related) test chamber conditions (geometry, degree of
    confinementâ€¦). LFL concentrations are typically lower than LEL concentrations
    for the same material and UFL concentrations are typically higher than UEL concentrations
    for the same material.
