data:
  definition: the final difference in decibels, when the sound articulation levels
    have been reduced to 80 %, between the attenuation in the reference system for
    the determination of AEN and that in a given telephone system, during articulation
    tests made in a given direction alternately on each system within increasing values
    of line attenuation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The AEN method is described in the CCITT Recommendation P12 from the Volume V
