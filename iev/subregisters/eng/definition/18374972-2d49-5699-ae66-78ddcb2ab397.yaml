  definition: number of {{supply interruptions, IEV:692-07-01}} experienced by the
    individual customers affected at least once during a time interval, divided by
    the product of the number of affected customers and the duration of that time
    interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If stem:[N]~NS~ is the number of customers affected and the supply of customer
    stem:[j] is interrupted stem:[n]~stem:[j]~ times during a time interval of duration
    stem:[T], then the interruption frequency per customer interrupted is given by


    stem:[f_((CI)) = ((sum_j n_j))/((N_(NS) T))]


    When determining stem:[N]~NS~, each customer affected must be counted only once,
    regardless of the number of interruptions experienced during that time interval.'
  - Usually, only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Interruption frequency per customer interrupted can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
