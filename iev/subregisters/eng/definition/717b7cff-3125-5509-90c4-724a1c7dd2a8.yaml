  definition: intermediate impurity level close to the valence band in extrinsic semiconductor
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The acceptor level is empty at the temperature of zero kelvin; at any other temperature
    it can receive electrons from the valence band. The acceptor levels can form narrow
    impurity bands.
