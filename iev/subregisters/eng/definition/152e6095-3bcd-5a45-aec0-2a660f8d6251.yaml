  definition: 'ordered set of stem:[n] linearly independent vectors stem:[a_1 , a_2
    , ... , a_n] in an stem:[n]-dimensional {{vector space, IEV:102-03-01}}, which
    is chosen to express any vector *stem:[U]* as a unique linear combination of these
    stem:[n] vectors


    stem:[U = U_1 a_1 + U_2 a_2 + ... + U_n a_n], where stem:[U_1 , U_2 , ... , U_n]
    are scalars'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In an Euclidean or Hermitian vector space, an orthonormal base is generally chosen.
    In the vector space formed by a set of stem:[n-]bit words (see Note 1 to entry
    in {{IEV 102-03-01, IEV:102-03-01}}, vector space) a base is the set of stem:[n-]bit
    words having only one non-zero bit.
  - Any vector of a base is called "base vector".
