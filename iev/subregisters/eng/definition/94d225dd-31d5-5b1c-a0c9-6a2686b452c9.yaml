data:
  definition: a form of modulation in which the average power spectral density of
    the transmitted signal is spread in a random or quasi-random way over a bandwidth
    which is much wider than the bandwidth required for the information to be transmitted
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Spread spectrum modulation permits multiple access to a communication path and
    increases immunity to noise and interference.
