  definition: 'density of incident radiant energy with respect to area at a point
    on a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[H_e = ((d Q_e))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Q]~e~ is radiant energy and stem:[A] is the area on which the radiant
    energy is incident'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quantity "radiant exposure" defined here must not be confused with the quantity
    named "exposure" which is used in the field of X- and γ-rays, the unit of which
    is coulomb per kilogram (C·kg^−1^).
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "luminous exposure". The corresponding
    quantity for photons is "photon exposure".
  - The radiant exposure is expressed in joule per square metre (J·m^−2^ = W·s·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-42 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
