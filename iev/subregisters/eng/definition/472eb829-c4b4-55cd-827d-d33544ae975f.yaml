    pressure. Sound pressure level in decibels is 20 times the logarithm to the base

  notes:
  - Unless otherwise specified, the reference sound pressure is 20 μPа for airborne
    sound and 1 μPa for sound in media other than air.
  - Unless otherwise specified, the sound pressures are understood to be expressed
