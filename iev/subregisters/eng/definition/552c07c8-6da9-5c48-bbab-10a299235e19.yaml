data:
  definition: for any point along a given direction in the far-field region of a transmitting
    antenna, the product of the distance from the antenna and the electric field vector
    produced by the antenna at that point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The field strength-distance product depends on the direction but not on the distance.
    Its magnitude expressed in volts is numerically equal to the magnitude of the
    field strength at a distance of 1 km expressed in millivolts per meter.
  - "The field strength-distance product depends on the electrical characteristics\
    \ of the antenna and the power fed to it.\r\n<note term force is used in the international\
    \ radio consultative committee></note>"
