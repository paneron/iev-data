  definition: function representing the relative spectral effectiveness of <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical
    radiation</a>, for a specified biological effect, in a specified system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The normalized action spectrum is the wavelength dependence of the inverse of
    the dose of <a href="IEV845-21-014">monochromatic radiation</a> required to induce
    a certain (biologic) response; the action spectrum is commonly normalized to a
    value of 1 at the wavelength of "maximum action", i.e. where the smallest dose
    suffices to induce the required effect.
