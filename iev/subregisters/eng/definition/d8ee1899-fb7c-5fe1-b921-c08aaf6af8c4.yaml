  definition: 'for a given vector space, set of elements called points, for which
    an element stem:[U_((AB))] of the vector space is associated to any ordered pair
    of points A and B with the following properties:




    * for any two points A and B, stem:[U_((BA)) = - U_((AB))],


    * for any three points A, B and C, stem:[U_((AB)) + U_((BC)) = U_((AC))],


    * for a given point O and a given vector *stem:[r]*, there is a unique point P
    such that stem:[U_((OP)) = r]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A point space and the associated vector space have the same dimension. The point
    space derived from the three-dimensional Euclidean vector space is a model of
    the usual geometrical three-dimensional space.
