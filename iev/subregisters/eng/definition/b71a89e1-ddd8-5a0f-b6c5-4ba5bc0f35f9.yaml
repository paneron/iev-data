data:
  definition: quotient of the total luminous flux of the luminaire, measured under
    specified conditions, and the sum of the individual luminous fluxes of the lamps
    when they are inside the luminaire
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For luminaires using incandescent lamps only, the optical light output ratio and
    the light output ratio are the same in practice.
  - The optical light output ratio has unit one.
