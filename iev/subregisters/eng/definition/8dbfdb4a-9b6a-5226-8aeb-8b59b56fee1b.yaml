  notes:
  - 'The definition in the SI Brochure is: "The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit
    of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant
    stem:[h] to be 6,626 070 15 × 10^−34^ when expressed in the unit J s, which is
    equal to kg m^2^ s^−1^, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of
    stem:[c] and Δstem:[ν]~Cs~."'
  - 'The definition of the kilogram in IEV 112-02-06:2010-01 was: "SI unit of mass,
    equal to the mass of the object called the “international prototype of the kilogram”
    kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)."'
  - 'The kilogram is one of the seven SI {{base units, IEV:112-01-18}}: {{second,
    IEV:112-02-04}} (s), {{metre, IEV:112-02-05}} (m), kilogram (kg), {{ampere, IEV:112-02-07}}
    (A), {{kelvin, IEV:112-02-08}} (K), {{mole, IEV:112-02-09}} (mol) and {{candela,
    IEV:112-02-10}} (cd).'
