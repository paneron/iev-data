  definition: for a two-terminal-pair network inserted between a given sinusoidal
    voltage or current source and a given load, ratio of the phasor representing the
    voltage or electric current at the load when connected directly to the source,
    to the phasor representing the voltage or current at the load when connected to
    the source through the network
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It must be specified whether a voltage or current source has been chosen and whether
    a voltage or current has been chosen at the load.
