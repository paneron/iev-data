  definition: 'ratio of the change in electrical {{resistance, IEV:131-12-04}} divided
    by the product of the original resistance (stem:[R]~o~, resistance in the undeformed
    configuration) and the engineering strain (stem:[e])


    stem:[G]~F~&amp;equals;(stem:[R]−stem:[R]~o~)/stem:[R]~o~stem:[e]


    where stem:[R] is the electrical resistance in the deformed configuration.'
