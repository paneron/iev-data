  definition: 'complex square matrix the elements of which have the property: stem:[A_((i
    j)) = A_(j i)^( * )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A Hermitian matrix *stem:[A]* is equal to its Hermitian conjugate matrix *stem:[A]*^H^.
  - All eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real.
  - Any symmetric matrix with real elements is a Hermitian matrix.
