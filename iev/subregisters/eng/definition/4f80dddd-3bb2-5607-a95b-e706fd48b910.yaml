data:
  definition: the dimension perpendicular to a scanning line of the finest recognizable
    detail of an image produced by the shortest signal transmitted by a facsimile
    transmitter under specified conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In phototelegraphy, the transmission resolution is dependent on the dimensions
    and the effective luminance of the finest detail in question.
  - In document facsimile, assuming that the contrast of the finest detail is adequate,
    the transmitted signal must correspond to a nominal black or a nominal white.
