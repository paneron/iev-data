data:
  definition: part of the insulation resistance which is due to conduction along the
    surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The surface resistance is in general strongly affected by the environment.
  - The surface resistance generally depends on the time of electrification and often
    varies in an erratic manner. In practice the electrification time is taken by
    convention as 1 min.
