  definition: ratio of the volume of pores to the total volume of an {{electrode,
    IEV:485-02-01}} material or of an {{electrolyte matrix, IEV:485-03-05}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The porosity features, such as overall open porosity, pore shape, size and size
    distribution, are key properties of the fuel cell electrode and significantly
    influence its performance.
