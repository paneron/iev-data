  definition: repetitive set of consecutive {{time-slots, IEV:704-13-08}} constituting
    a complete cycle of a {{signal, IEV:101-12-02}} or another process in which the
    relative position of each time-slot in the cycle can be identified
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In English, the term "frame" has different meanings in the fields of time division
    multiplexing (see {{IEV 704-14-01, IEV:704-14-01}}), switching (see {{IEV 714-15-09,
    IEV:714-15-09}}), television (see {{IEV 723-05-25, IEV:723-05-25}}), time division
    multiple access (see {{IEV 725-14-18, IEV:725-14-18}}), digital processing (see
    {{IEV 807-01-03, IEV:807-01-03}}), rotating electric machines (see {{IEV 811-14-02,

    In some English-speaking countries, the term “frame” is also used in television
    to mean a subdivision of a {{field, IEV:723-05-17}}.
  - In French, the term "trame" has different meanings in the fields of beam focusing
    and deflection in electronic tubes (see {{IEV 531-14-20, IEV:531-14-20}}), time
    division multiplexing (see {{IEV 704-14-01, IEV:704-14-01}}), switching (see {{IEV
    714-15-09, IEV:714-15-09}}), television (see {{IEV 723-05-17, IEV:723-05-17}}),
