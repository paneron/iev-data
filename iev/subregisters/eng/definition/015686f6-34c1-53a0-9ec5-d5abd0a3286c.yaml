  definition: failures of multiple items, which would otherwise be considered independent
    of one another, resulting from a single cause
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Common cause failures can also be "common mode failures" ({{IEV 192-03-19, IEV:192-03-19}}).
  - The potential for common cause failures reduces the effectiveness of system redundancy.
