  definition: a type of linear distortion occurring when the amplitude/frequency characteristic
    of a transmission channel or two-port device deviates from the ideal form in the
    useful frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ideal form of the amplitude/frequency characteristic is a straight line of
    constant ordinate.
  - In some fields such as line transmission "distorsion d'affaiblissement" in French
    and "attenuation/frequency distortion" in English are the preferred terms.
