  definition: coating process in which a part to be coated is dipped into a fluidized
    bed of powdered plastic particles and usually subsequently heated to fuse the

  examples: []

  - 'The process may be executed either:


    1) by preheating the part to be coated to make powdered plastic particles in the
    fluidized bed adhere to it, or


    2) by dipping the part to be coated, which must be at least slightly electrically
    conductive and earthed, cold into a fluidized bed of electrostatically charged
    powdered plastic particles and subsequently fuse  the adhering particles to it
    by heating.'
