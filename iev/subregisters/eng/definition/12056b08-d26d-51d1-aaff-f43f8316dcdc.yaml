  definition: 'a quantity defined for a mode of propagation at a given frequency in
    a specific uniform transmission line or uniform waveguide by one of the three
    following relations:


    <u>stem:[Z]</u>~1~ = <u>stem:[S]</u>/ |<u>stem:[I]</u>|^2^


    <u>stem:[Z]</u>~2~ = |<u>stem:[U]</u>|^2^ / <u>stem:[S]</u>


    <u>stem:[Z]</u>~3~ = <u>stem:[U]</u> / <u>stem:[I]</u>


    where <u>stem:[Z]</u> is the complex characteristic impedance, <u>stem:[S]</u>
    the complex power and <u>stem:[U]</u> and <u>stem:[I]</u> are the values, usually
    complex, respectively of a voltage and a current conventionally defined for each
    type of mode by analogy with transmission line equations


    Examples:


    1. — For a parallel-wire transmission line, <u>stem:[U]</u> and <u>stem:[I]</u>
    can be uniquely defined and the three equations are consistent. If the transmission
    line is lossless, the characteristic impedance is real.


    2. — For a waveguide, the conventional definitions for <u>stem:[U]</u> and <u>stem:[I]</u>
    depend on the type of mode and generally lead to three different values of the
    characteristic impedance.


    3. — For a circular waveguide in the dominant mode stem:[ТЕ]~11~, stem:[U] = r.m.s.
    voltage along the diameter where the magnitude of the electric field strength
    vector is a maximum, stem:[I] = the r.m.s. longitudinal current.


    4. — For a rectangular waveguide in the dominant mode stem:[TE]~10~, stem:[U]
    = the r.m.s. voltage between midpoints of the two conductor faces normal to the
    electric field strength vector, stem:[I] = the r.m.s. longitudinal current following
    on one surface normal to the electric field strength vector.'
