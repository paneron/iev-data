  definition: for a given type of interaction of incident particles with a target,
    a quantity equal to the product of the probability of interaction of the target
    with a particle and the cross-sectional area of an infinitesimal sphere, divided
    by the number of particles incident on the sphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The cross-section has the dimension of area. A non-SI unit is barn, symbol b:
    1 b:= 10^âˆ’28^ m^2^.'
