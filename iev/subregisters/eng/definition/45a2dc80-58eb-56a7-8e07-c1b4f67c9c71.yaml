  definition: diagram showing gain and phase angle contours of the closed-loop frequency
    response stem:[((G_0))/((1 + G_0))] plotted in the rectangular coordinates of
    logarithmic gain and phase difference of the open-loop frequency response stem:[G]~0~
  examples: []
  notes:
  - stem:[((G_0))/((1 + G_0))] is the closed-loop frequency response for changes of
    the reference variable in the case that the controlled variable stem:[x] is used
    as the feedback variable stem:[r] directly. The transfer function of the measuring
    element is assumed unity.
