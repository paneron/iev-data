  definition: sampling of a picture where the points on the scanning lines corresponding
    to the sampling instants are aligned in the picture perpendicularly to the scanning
    line direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the case of progressive scanning, the points in a scanning line are aligned
    with those points in the temporally adjacent lines of the same field; in the case
    of interlaced scanning, the points in a scanning line are aligned with those points
    in the spatially adjacent lines of the preceding field.
