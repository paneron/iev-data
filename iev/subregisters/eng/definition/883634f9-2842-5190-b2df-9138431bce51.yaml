  definition: 'density of incident photon flux with respect to area at a point on
    a real or imaginary surface


    stem:[E_p = ((d Phi_p))/((d A))]


    where stem:[Φ]~p~ is photon flux and stem:[A] is the area on which the photon
    flux is incident'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "irradiance". The corresponding photometric
    quantity is "illuminance".
  - The photon irradiance is expressed in second to the power minus one per square
    metre (s^−1^·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-39 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
