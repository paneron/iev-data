  definition: a controllable valve device which latches when it is turned on, that
    means it remains in the on state when the trigger signal has ended
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Most latching valve devices can be turned off only by suppressing the current
    through the conducting path by external means.
  - A gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor is a latching valve device which can be turned
    off by a control signal.
  - A latching valve device may be reverse blocking or non-reverse blocking.
