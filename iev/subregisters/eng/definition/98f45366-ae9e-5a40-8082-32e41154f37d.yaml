  definition: form of cross-bonding in which three consecutive elementary sections,
    termed “minor sections”, are taken to form a single unit, termed a “major section”
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The three shields are solidly bonded at both ends of a major section and may be
    earthed at these points. At the two intermediate positions, the cables are usually
    transposed and the shields are so interconnected that each continuous shield circuit
    through the major section occupies the same geometrical position in the cable
    formation. For long cable routes, there may be a number of major sections.
