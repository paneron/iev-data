  definition: process of changing the {{digit rate, IEV:702-05-23}} of a {{digital
    signal, IEV:702-04-05}} in a controlled manner without loss or mutilation of information
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Pulse stuffing is usually employed as an adjunct to {{digital multiplexing, IEV:704-20-01}}
    to enable the multiplexing to be applied to tributary channels that are not synchronized
    to the {{multiplexer, IEV:704-08-13}}. Where this is done, the original signal
    of each channel is independently justified.
  - Associated verbs are “to stuff” and “to justify”.
