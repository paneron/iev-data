  definition: a type of linear distortion occurring when the group delay from input
    to output of a transmission channel or two port device varies over the useful
    frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The group delay/frequency distortion is a phase/frequency distortion characterized
    by the fact that the phase/frequency characteristic is not a straight line for
    the frequencies of the significant spectral components of the signal.
