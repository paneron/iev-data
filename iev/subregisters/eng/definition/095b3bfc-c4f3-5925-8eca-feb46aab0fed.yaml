data:
  definition: the direction of the normal to the wavefront at a given point, positive
    in the direction of increasing phase
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The direction of propagation at a point is that of the real component of the wave
    vector.
  - The direction of propagation of a wave may differ from the direction of propagation
    of energy for this wave.
