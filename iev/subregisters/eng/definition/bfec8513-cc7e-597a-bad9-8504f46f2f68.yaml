  definition: means of radiocommunication between two specified points, which uses
    tropospheric propagation by means of directional antennas and which can include
    one or more relay stations, with radio characteristics identical to those of the
    end stations
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term “tropospheric propagation” denotes any propagation within the troposphere
    and by extension beneath the ionosphere when not influenced by the ionosphere.
  - Radio-relay systems operate at frequencies above 30 MHz and, in the most cases,
    above 1 GHz, i.e. in microwaves.
