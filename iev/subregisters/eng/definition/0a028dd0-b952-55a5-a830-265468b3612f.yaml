data:
  definition: image state associated with image data that represents the colour space
    coordinates of the elements of an image that has undergone colour rendering appropriate
    for a specified real or virtual output device and viewing conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the phrase "output-referred" is used as a qualifier to an object, it implies
    that the object is in an output-referred image state. For example, output-referred
    image data are image data in an output-referred image state.
  - Output referred image data are referred to the specified output device and viewing
    conditions. A single scene can be colour rendered to a variety of output-referred
    representations depending on the anticipated output viewing conditions, media
    limitations, and/or artistic intents.
  - Output-referred image data can become the starting point for a subsequent reproduction
    process. For example, sRGB output-referred image data are frequently considered
    to be the starting point for the colour re-rendering performed by a printer designed
    to receive sRGB image data.
