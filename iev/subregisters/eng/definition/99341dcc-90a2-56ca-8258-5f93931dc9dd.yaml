  definition: real vector being tangent to a given oriented curve at a given point,
    the magnitude of which is the absolute value of the scalar line element at the
    given point and the direction of which corresponds to the orientation of the curve
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A vector line element is preferably designated by stem:[e_t d s] or by stem:[d
    r], or sometimes by stem:[t d s], where stem:[e_t = t] is a unit vector tangential
    to the curve, stem:[d s] is a scalar line element, stem:[d r] is the differential
    of the position vector *stem:[r]* describing the curve with respect to an origin
    point.
