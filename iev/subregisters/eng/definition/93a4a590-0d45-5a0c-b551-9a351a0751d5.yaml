  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the heat transfer by natural
    convection in a fluid, defined by stem:[G r = ((l^3 g alpha_V Delta T))/((nu^2))],
    where stem:[l] is a specified length, stem:[g] is acceleration of free fall, stem:[α]~stem:[V]~
    is cubic expansion coefficient, Δstem:[T] is thermodynamic temperature difference,
    and stem:[ν] is kinematic viscosity
