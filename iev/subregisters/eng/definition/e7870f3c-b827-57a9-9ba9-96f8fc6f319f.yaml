  definition: 'the quotient of stem:[E] by stem:[bar N], where stem:[bar N] is the
    mean number of ion pairs formed when the initial kinetic energy stem:[E] of a
    charged particle is completely dissipated in the gas


    stem:[W = (E)/(bar N)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The ions produced by the bremsstrahlung emitted by the charged particle must be
    counted in stem:[bar N].
