data:
  definition: a basic principle stating that no passive optical system can increase
    the quantity stem:[L]•n^-2^ where stem:[L] is the radiance of a beam and stem:[n]
    is local refractive index
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The quantity stem:[L]•n^-2^ would be constant if the losses by absorption, scattering
    etc. were zero.
