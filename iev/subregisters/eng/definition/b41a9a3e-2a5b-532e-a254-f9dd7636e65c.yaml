  definition: tensor of the second order with components stem:[T_((i j)) = delta_((i
    j))] where stem:[delta_((i j))] is the Kronecker delta, equal to 1 if stem:[i]
    = stem:[j] and 0 if stem:[i] â‰  stem:[j]
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The components of the Kronecker tensor are independent of the base used. The inner
    product of the Kronecker tensor and a tensor or a vector is equal to this tensor
    or vector.
  - When the properties of an anisotropic medium are represented at each point by
    a tensor quantity of the second order, this quantity reduces, in an isotropic
    medium, to the product of the Kronecker tensor and a scalar quantity. In practice,
    the quantity is then considered as a scalar quantity.
