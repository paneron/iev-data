  definition: for an input signal including a sinusoidal oscillation of small amplitude
    superimposed on a DC component, a type of non-linearity distortion characterized
    by an undesired variation of the ratio of the amplitude of the fundamental component
    of the output oscillation to the amplitude of the input oscillation as a function
    of the value of the input DC component
