  definition: 'difference between one and the ratio of the square of the mutual permeance
    stem:[Λij] related to two circuit elements stem:[i] and stem:[j] to the product
    of their self-permeances stem:[Λii] and stem:[Λjj]


    stem:[sigma_((i j)) = 1 - ((Lambda_(i j)^2))/((Lambda_((i i)) Lambda_((j j))))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The inductive leakage factor is related to the inductive coupling factor stem:[kij]
    by the formula:


    stem:[k_(i j)^2 = 1 - sigma_((i j))]'
