  definition: smallest illuminance (point brilliance), produced at the eye of an observer
    by a light source seen in point vision, which renders the source perceptible against
    a background of given luminance, where the illuminance is considered on a surface
    element that is normal to the incident rays at the eye
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For visual signalling, the light source has to be rendered recognizable, and hence
    a higher threshold of illuminance is to be expected.
