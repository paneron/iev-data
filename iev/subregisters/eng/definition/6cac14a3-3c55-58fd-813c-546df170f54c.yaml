  definition: '{{stable state, IEV:692-02-02}} in which some system components are
    stressed beyond their ratings, or some bus voltages or system frequency are outside
    tolerances

  notes:
  - In an emergency state, urgent actions (such as load shedding; reducing voltage;
    and starting emergency generators) are required to prevent equipment damage and/or
    further degradation of system state.
  - Although {{loss of load, IEV:692-01-16}} can occur, it is not a criterion for
    an emergency state.
  - This entry was numbered 191-22-05 in IEC 60050-191:1990.
