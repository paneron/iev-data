  definition: the difference between the total loss and the sum of the eddy current
    and hysteresis losses
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a magnetic material, the division of the losses into eddy current loss, hysteresis
    loss and residual loss is based on assumptions that are not entirely justified.
    The definitions given here represent the accepted technical usage.
