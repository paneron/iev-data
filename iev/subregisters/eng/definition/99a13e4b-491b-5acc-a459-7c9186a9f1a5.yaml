  definition: irradiance, when used in photochemistry, phototherapy and photobiology
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When reporting the dose rate, the <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a>
    of the <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a> shall be specified.
  - The notion of rate applies similarly to actinic dose and effective dose.
  - The dose rate is expressed in watt per square metre (W·m^−2^).
  - This entry was numbered 845-06-25 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
