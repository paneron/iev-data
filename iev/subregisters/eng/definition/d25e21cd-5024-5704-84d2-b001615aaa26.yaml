  notes:
  - 'Luminous flux is a quantity derived from the radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~e~, by evaluating
    the radiation according to its action upon the <a href="IEV845-21-036">CIE standard
    photometric observer</a>. Luminous flux can be derived from the spectral radiant
    flux distribution by


    stem:[Phi_v = K_m int_0^(oo) Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) V ( lambda ) d lambda]


    where stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[Φ]~e,stem:[λ]~(stem:[λ])
    is spectral radiant flux, stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral
    luminous efficiency</a> and stem:[λ] is wavelength.'
  - 'The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of
    emission, e.g. given by the polar angles (stem:[ϑ], stem:[φ]), is used to determine
    the luminous flux, stem:[Φ]~v~, within a certain solid angle, stem:[Ω], of a source:


    stem:[Phi_v = underset(omega)( ∬ ) I_v ( vartheta , phi ) sin vartheta \ d phi
    \ d vartheta].'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiant flux". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon flux".
  - The luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
