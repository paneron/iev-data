data:
  definition: in a radio receiver using frequency translation, the frequency symmetrical
    to the frequency of the radio-frequency signal considered at the input, with respect
    to the frequency of the first local oscillator
  examples: []
  notes:
  - There is an image frequency only if the frequency of the local oscillator is at
    least equal to half the frequency of the input signal.
