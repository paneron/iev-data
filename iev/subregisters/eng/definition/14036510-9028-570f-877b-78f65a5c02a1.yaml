  definition: domain wall in which the vector component of the magnetic area moment
    perpendicular to the plane of the wall is substantially constant, within and on
    either side of the wall
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Bloch walls are normally found only in bulk materials and thick films; in thinner
    films below a critical thickness, the formation of NÃ©el walls is favourable from
    energy considerations.
