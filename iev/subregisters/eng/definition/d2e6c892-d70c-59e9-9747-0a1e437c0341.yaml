  concept: dc5e50fc-f800-507f-8b19-ad959cbc37e2
  definition: electric current flowing along and between superconducting filaments
    which are separated by normal conducting materials, due to the induction in a
    changing magnetic field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the normal conducting matrix of the superconductor, this current flows approximately
    perpendicular to the filaments.
