  definition: area associated with a terrestrial transmitting station for a given
    radiocommunication service, within which a receiving station must be located for
    radiocommunication of a specified nature to be established under specified technical
    conditions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Several coverage areas may be associated with the same station.
  - 'The technical conditions include, inter alia, the following: frequency, characteristics
    of the equipment used both at the transmitting and receiving stations, how it
    is installed, quality of transmission desired, e.g. protection ratios, and operating
    conditions.'
  - 'The following may be distinguishable:


    – the coverage area in the absence of RF interference, i.e. that limited solely
    by natural or artificial noise;


    – the nominal coverage area which is defined, when establishing a frequency plan
    by taking into account the foreseen transmitters;


    – the actual coverage area, i.e., with allowance made for the noise and interference
    which exist in practice.'
