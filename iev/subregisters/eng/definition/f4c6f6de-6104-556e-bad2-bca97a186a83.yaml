  definition: continuous part of the radio-frequency spectrum to be used for a specified
    emission or transmission
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A radio-frequency channel may be defined by two specified limits, or by its centre
    frequency and its bandwidth, or any equivalent indication. It is often designated
    by a sequential number in some applications.
  - A radio-frequency channel may be time-shared in order to allow radiocommunication
    in both directions by simplex operation.
  - The term “channel” is sometimes used to denote two associated radio-frequency
    channels, each of which is used for one of two directions of transmission, i.e.
    in fact a telecommunication circuit. In French, the term “canaux jumelés” should
    be used in this sense.
