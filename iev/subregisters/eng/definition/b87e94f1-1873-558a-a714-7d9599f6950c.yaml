  notes:
  - 'For the purpose of evaluating creepage distances and clearances, the following
    four pollution degrees in the microenvironment are established in 2.5.1 of IEC
    60664-1:1992.


    a)  pollution degree 1: No pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs.
    The pollution has no influence.


    b)  pollution degree 2: Only non-conductive pollution occurs except that occasionally
    a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected.


    c)  pollution degree 3: Conductive pollution occurs, or dry, non-conductive pollution
    occurs which becomes conductive due to condensation is to be expected


    d)  pollution degree 4: The pollution generates persistent conductivity caused
    by conductive dust or by rain or snow.'
