data:
  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the partial gain of an
    antenna, in a given direction and for a specified linear polarization, to the
    maximum absolute gain of a half-wave dipole isolated in space and oriented in
    a direction parallel to the electric flux density vector characterizing the specified
    polarization in the given direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If no direction is specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity from
    the given antenna is implied.
  - When the gain relative to a half-wave dipole is expressed in decibels, the notation
    dBd is recommended by the International Telecommunication Union as a unit symbol.
