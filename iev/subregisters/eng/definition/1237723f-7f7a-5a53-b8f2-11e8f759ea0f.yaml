        modification: Addition of information useful for the context of the IEV, and
          adaptation to the IEV rules
        type: modified
  concept: 60667c28-d887-54e5-8db8-8df5a43baef6
  definition: 'difference between the {{information content, IEV:171-07-14}} stem:[I](stem:[x])
    conveyed by the occurrence of an event stem:[x], and the conditional information
    content stem:[I ( x | y )] conveyed by the occurrence of the same event, given
    the occurrence of another event stem:[y]


    stem:[T ( x , y ) = I ( x ) - I ( x | y )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The two events are particularly a message at the message source of a channel and
    a message at the message sink of the channel.
  - 'The transinformation content can also be expressed as: stem:[T ( x , y ) = I
    ( x ) + I ( y ) - I ( x , y )], where stem:[I](stem:[y]) is the information content
    of the event stem:[y]. From this follows that it is symmetric in stem:[x] and
    stem:[y]: stem:[T ( x , y ) = T ( y , x )].'
