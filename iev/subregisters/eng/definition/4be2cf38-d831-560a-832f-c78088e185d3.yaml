  definition: type of preheating of the electrodes of a discharge lamp in which the
    electrodes are fed by separate circuits
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Each electrode is usually connected across a low-voltage winding that can be part
    of the ballast and provides the preheating current. In certain circuits, this
    low voltage is automatically decreased after the arc has struck.
