  definition: equilibrium position to which the indicating device tends to return,
    due only to mechanical restoring forces, when the measuring element is not energized
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In instruments with a mechanically suppressed zero, the equilibrium position is
    outside the scale marking.
  - In certain instruments such as flux meters and quotient-meters, the mechanical
    zero is indeterminate.
