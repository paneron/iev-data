  definition: ". wave which appears beyond a surface separating two different media\

    \ generally in a different direction, and which is interpretable by geometric\
    \ optics \n\n.  wave which propagates in a medium with properties varying continuously\
    \ in space and which is interpretable by geometric optics"
