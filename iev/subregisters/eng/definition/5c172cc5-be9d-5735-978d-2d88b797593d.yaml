  definition: production process of superconducting composite wires
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Cross-section area-reducing processes, such as wire drawing and rolling, and heat-treatment
    processes are applied to an assembly made of several basic materials in order
    to obtain a composite of superconducting filaments inside the wire matrix.
