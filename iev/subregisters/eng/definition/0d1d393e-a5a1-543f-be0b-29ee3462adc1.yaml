data:
  definition: in a vestigial sideband television receiver, half of the frequency bandwidth,
    centred on the vision carrier frequency, over which there is a sensibly linear
    reduction of amplitude with frequency, from the frequency at which the amplitude
    is equal to that in the complete sideband, down to the frequency where the amplitude
    is negligible
