  definition: type of flat panel display common to large television displays (81Â cm
    or larger) consisting of a matrix of pixels between two glass plates holding an
    inert mixture of noble gases that can be turned into a plasma by applying a voltage
    across the cell such that the plasma starts emitting electrons, which then excite
    phosphors to emit light and create a colour image
