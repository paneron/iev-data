  definition: a series of fuse-links, deviating from each other only in such characteristics
    that, for a given test, the testing of one or a reduced number of particular fuse-link(s)
    of that series may be taken as representative for all the fuse-links of the homogeneous
    series
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The relevant publications specify the characteristics by which the fuse-links
    of a homogeneous series may deviate, the particular fuse-links to be tested and
    the specific test concerned.
