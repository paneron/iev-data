  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[E] by the product of stem:[ρ] and dstem:[l]
    where dstem:[E] is the energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy in
    traversing a path length dstem:[l] in a material of density stem:[ρ]


    stem:[(S)/(rho) = (1)/(rho) ((d E))/((d l))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For energies at which nuclear interaction can be neglected, the total mass stopping
    power is the sum of the collision mass stopping power and the radiative mass stopping
    power.
