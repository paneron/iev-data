  definition: asymmetric resistive two-terminal element characterized by zero voltage
    between the terminals when the electric current in it is directed from one terminal
    denoted A to the other denoted B and zero electric current when the electric potential
    at terminal A is less than or equal to the potential at terminal B
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The functional relation between voltage stem:[u]~AB~ and electric current stem:[i]
    is:


    stem:[u]~AB~ = 0 when stem:[i] ≥ 0


    stem:[i] = 0 when stem:[u]~AB~ ≤ 0


    where the reference direction for the electric current is from A to B.'
