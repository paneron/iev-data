data:
  definition: the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio at the output of a demodulator
    due to a modulation type compared to a reference modulation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The modulation gain is expressed by the signal to noise ratio at the demodulator
    output, divided by the carrier-to-noise ratio at the input.
