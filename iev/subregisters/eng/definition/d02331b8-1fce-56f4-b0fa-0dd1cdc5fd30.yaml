data:
  definition: paint, pigment or dye that exhibits fluorescence as the result of exposure
    to daylight
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Daylight fluorescent colours absorb energy from daylight in the shorter wavelength
    regions of the visible spectrum and/or in the ultraviolet region and re-radiate
    some of this energy at longer wavelengths, producing radiation in a small range
    of wavelengths in the visible region.
