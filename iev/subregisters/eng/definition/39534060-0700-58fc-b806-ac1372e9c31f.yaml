  definition: 'temperature of the Planckian radiator whose <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative
    spectral distribution</a>, stem:[S](stem:[λ]) is the same or nearly the same as
    that of the radiation considered in the spectral range of interest for which the
    following integral is minimized by adjustment of stem:[a] and stem:[T]:


    stem:[int_((lambda_1))^((lambda_2)) 1 - ((S_t ( lambda )))/((a S_b ( lambda ,
    T )))^2 d lambda]


    where stem:[λ] is the wavelength, stem:[S]~t~(stem:[λ]) is the <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative
    spectral distribution</a> of the radiation being considered, stem:[S]~b~(stem:[λ],
    stem:[T]) is the relative spectral distribution of the Planckian radiator at temperature
    stem:[T], and stem:[a] is a scaling factor'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The scaling factor stem:[a] is chosen to make the quotient stem:[((S_t ( lambda
    )))/((S_b ( lambda , T )))] equal to unity at a convenient wavelength which, in
    photometry and colorimetry is typically 560 nm.


    stem:[S_b ( lambda , T ) = ((P ( lambda , T )))/((P ( 560 nm , T )))]


    with stem:[P ( lambda , T ) = lambda^(- 5) ( e^(((c_2))/((lambda T))) - 1 )^(-
    1)], where stem:[c]~2~ is the second radiation constant.'
  - Distribution temperature is a meaningful characteristic for radiators having a
    <a href="IEV845-21-030">relative spectral distribution</a> similar to that of
    a Planckian radiator, but only if calculated for an expanded wavelength range
    and for radiation whose <a href="IEV845-21-029">spectral distribution</a> of radiant
    flux is a continuous function of wavelength in that range.
  - In photometry and colorimetry the wavelength range set by stem:[λ]~1~ and stem:[λ]~2~
    is the visible spectral range, and in these cases the range from at least stem:[λ]~1~
    = 400 nm to stem:[λ]~2~ = 750 nm is recommended.
  - In practice, the integral is replaced by a summation. For <a href="IEV845-27-011">incandescent
    lamps</a>, equally spaced wavelength intervals of 10 nm will usually suffice.
    All values in the summation are treated with equal weight.
  - The distribution temperature is expressed in kelvin (K).
