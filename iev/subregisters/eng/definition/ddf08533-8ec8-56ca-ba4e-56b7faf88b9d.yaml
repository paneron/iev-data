  definition: value of the test voltage to be applied under specified conditions in
    a withstand test, during which a specified number of disruptive discharges is
    tolerated
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The withstand voltage is designated as:


    a) conventional assumed withstand voltage, when the number of disruptive discharges
    tolerated is zero. It is deemed to correspond to a withstand probability stem:[P]~W~
    = 100 % (this is in particular the case in the low-voltage technology);


    b) statistical withstand voltage, when the number of disruptive discharges tolerated
    is related to a specified withstand probability, for instance stem:[P]~W~ = 90
    %.'
