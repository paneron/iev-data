  definition: 'quotient of the radiant flux or luminous flux stem:[Φ]~2~ (or stem:[Φ]~1~)
    that surface S~1~ (or S~2~) sends to surface S~2~ (or S~1~) and the <a href="IEV845-21-080">radiant
    exitance</a> or <a href="IEV845-21-081">luminous exitance</a> stem:[M]~1~ (or
    stem:[M]~2~)


    stem:[g = ((Phi_2))/((M_1)) = ((Phi_1))/((M_2))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Since stem:[M] = πstem:[L], and in the particular case where all points on S~1~
    are seen from all points on S~2~


    stem:[g = (1)/(pi) underset((A_2))( int ) underset((A_1))( int ) ((cos theta_1
    cos theta_2))/((l^2)) d A_1 d A_2 = (1)/(pi) G]


    where stem:[l] is the distance between the elements of areas dstem:[A]~1~ and
    dstem:[A]~2~ on the surfaces S~1~ and S~2~, stem:[G] is the geometric extent of
    the beam delimited by the boundaries of S~1~ and S~2~, and stem:[θ]~1~ and stem:[θ]~2~
    are the angles between the surface normals of the two elementary areas dstem:[A]~1~
    and dstem:[A]~2~ respectively and the line joining the two elementary areas.'
  - 'For two elementary areas dA~1~ and dA~2~


    stem:[d g = (1)/(pi) d A_1 d omega_1 cos theta_1 = (1)/(pi) d A_2 d omega_2 cos
    theta_2]


    where dstem:[Ω]~1~ (or dstem:[Ω]~2~) is the solid angle which the area dstem:[A]~2~
    (or dstem:[A]~1~) subtends from the centre of dstem:[A]~1~ (or dstem:[A]~2~).'
  - 'The radiance or luminance stem:[L] of the beam delimited by the boundaries of
    dA~1~ and dA~2~ is


    stem:[L = (1)/(pi) ((d Phi))/((d g))].'
  - The mutual exchange coefficient is expressed in square metre (m^2^).
