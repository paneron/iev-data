  definition: the aggregate transfer rate of signal elements in a transmission link,
    expressed in normalized form in binary digits per second
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The signalling rate is given by


    stem:[sum_((i = 1))^((i = m)) (1)/((T_i)) (log)_2 n_i]


    where stem:[m] is the number of parallel transmission channels, stem:[Ð¢]~stem:[i]~
    is the shortest theoretical duration of signal element for the stem:[i]-th channel
    expressed in seconds, and stem:[n]~stem:[i]~ is the number of significant conditions
    of the modulation in the stem:[i]-th channel.'
  - The symbol of the unit of binary rate is bit/s.
