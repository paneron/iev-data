        adaptation to the IEV rules
      type: modified
  definition: maximum possible {{average transinformation rate, IEV:171-07-31}}, which
    can be achieved with an arbitrary small {{error probability, IEV:171-06-08}} by
    use of an appropriate {{code, IEV:171-01-15}}

  notes:
  - The channel time capacity is one way to express quantitatively the ability of
    a given channel subject to specific constraints to transmit messages from a specified
    message source.
  - The channel time capacity can be expressed in a unit such as the shannon per second
    (Sh/s).
