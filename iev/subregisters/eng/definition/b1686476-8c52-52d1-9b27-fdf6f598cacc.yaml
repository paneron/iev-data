  definition: conventional physical constant which relates the {{amount of substance,
    IEV:113-02-07}} to the number of entities in a given sample, the value of which
    is set to 6,022 140 76 × 10^23^ {{mol, IEV:112-02-09}}^−1^
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The definition of the Avogadro constant in IEV 113-02-08:2014-05 was: "fundamental
    physical constant equal to the number stem:[N] of elementary entities in a given
    sample of matter, divided by the amount of substance stem:[n] of that sample,
    stem:[N]~A~=stem:[N]/stem:[n]", incorrectly describing the Avogadro constant as
    a "fundamental physical constant".'
  - The Avogadro constant is used in the {{SI, IEV:112-02-02}} to define the {{mole,
    IEV:112-02-09}}.
  - The term “Avogadro number” is deprecated since a number is a quantity with unit
    one, and it is used for a different concept (see {{IEV 113-02-18, IEV:113-02-18}}).
