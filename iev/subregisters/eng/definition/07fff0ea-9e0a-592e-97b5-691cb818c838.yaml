  definition: energy emitted, transferred or received in the form of electromagnetic
    waves
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Radiant energy can be expressed by the time integral of radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~e~,
    over a given duration, Δstem:[t]:


    stem:[Q_e = int_((Delta t)) Phi_e d t]'
  - Radiant energy is expressed as a function of wavelength, stem:[λ], as a function
    of {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}, stem:[ν], or as a function of <a href="IEV845-21-026">wavenumber</a>,
    stem:[σ].
  - The corresponding photometric quantity is "<a href="IEV845-21-037">luminous energy</a>".
    The corresponding quantity for photons is "photon energy".
  - The radiant energy is expressed in joule (J = W·s).
  - This entry was numbered 845-01-27 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
