    of the spatial frequency of the initial signal
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The modulation transfer function measures the loss of information from an input
    signal to an image-forming system owing to inherent characteristics of components
    of the system. For example, a measure of the loss of sharpness and contrast in
    an X-ray film and intensifying screen combination.
