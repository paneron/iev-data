  definition: minimum distance in air to be maintained between any part of the body
    of a worker, including any object (except {{tools, IEV:651-21-14}} appropriate
    for {{live working, IEV:651-21-01}}) being handled directly, and any part(s) at
    different electric potential(s)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The minimum approach distance is the sum of the {{electrical distance, IEV:651-21-12}}
    appropriate for the maximum nominal voltage and of the selected {{ergonomic distance,
    IEV:651-21-13}}.
