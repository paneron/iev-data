  definition: 'of a charged particle in a medium; the quotient of dstem:[E] by dstem:[l]
    where dstem:[l] is the distance traversed by a particle and dstem:[E] is the energy
    loss due to collisions with energy transfer less than a specified value stem:[Δ]
    usually expressed in electron volts


    stem:[L_(Delta) = (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_(Delta)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Although the definition specifies an energy cutoff and not a range cutoff the
    energy losses are sometimes called "energy locally imparted".


    Examples: stem:[L]~100~ means linear energy transfer for collisions with energy
    transfers less than 100 eV; stem:[L]~∞~ means linear energy transfer when all
    possible energy transfers are included.


    stem:[L]~∞~ = stem:[S]~col~'
