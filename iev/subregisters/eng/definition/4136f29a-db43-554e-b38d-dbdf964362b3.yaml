  definition: dielectric resonator characterized by the existence of several orthogonal
    resonance modes
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Any electromagnetic field perturbation affects the independence of one certain
    of these modes and causes energy coupling between them. This allows realization
    of reduced volume filters.
