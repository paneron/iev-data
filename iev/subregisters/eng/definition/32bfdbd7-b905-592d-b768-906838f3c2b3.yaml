  definition: for a quantity having a continuous spectrum and a finite mean power,
    limit, at any frequency, of the quotient of the power within a frequency band
    containing that frequency by the bandwidth when the bandwidth tends to zero
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The instantaneous power of a quantity is by convention equal to the square of
    its instantaneous value. This square is proportional to a physical power if the
    considered quantity is a field quantity.
  - The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function.
