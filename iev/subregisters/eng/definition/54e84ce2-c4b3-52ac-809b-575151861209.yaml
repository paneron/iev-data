  definition: passive two-terminal element characterized by a functional relation
    between the voltage between the terminals and the time integral of the electric
    current in the element
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The electric energy absorbed by a capacitive two-terminal element is stored under
    electrostatic form and is completely restitutable.
