  definition: the totality of digits and possibly other characters at a point in the
    network which locate the called party, or those digits which are necessary for
    forward routing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The digits comprising the address information sent by the calling party may be
    changed by translation and/or digit absorption as a connection is progressively
    set up through the network, but the new and/or remaining digits at each point
    constitute the address information at this point.
