      modification: The definition has been rewritten, and the end of Note 1 to entry
        has been changed from "so that special packaging techniques are being studied"
        to "which has resulted in special packaging techniques being studied".
      type: modified
  definition: process for protecting  {{components, IEV:151-11-21}} by mounting them
    in a container having external terminals
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The purpose of packaging is to minimize external chemical and physical damage
    to the components. As the {{device, IEV:151-11-20}} is miniaturized, strain due
    to the packaging stress is possibly troublesome. To prevent this, amongst other
    things, the {{bonding, IEV:523-06-01}} technology that joins microcomponents and
    so on to a silicon chip is important. In the field of {{sensor, IEV:151-13-48}}
    systems, a hybrid integration technology is necessary, which has resulted in special
    packaging techniques being studied.
