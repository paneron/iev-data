    colour stimulus, in an additive mixture with a specified achromatic stimulus,
    which matches the stimulus of the colour under consideration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In television the concept of saturation is analogous to the concept of colour
    purity utilized in colorimetry.
  - The saturation of a colour becomes the greater as it approaches a monochromatic
    colour.
  - In the case of purple stimuli the monochromatic stimulus is replaced by a stimulus
    which corresponds to a point on the purple boundary.
