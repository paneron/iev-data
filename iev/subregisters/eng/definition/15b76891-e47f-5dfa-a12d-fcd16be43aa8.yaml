    impedance is equal to the load impedance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a symmetrical two-port network, this term may be applied to denote the common
    value assumed by the two image impedances and the two iterative impedances.
  - Another definition is given in IEC 60050-726 and the term has another meaning
    for free space in IEC 60050-705.
