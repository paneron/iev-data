  definition: 'quantity representing the quantities in a finite set or in an interval,



    . for stem:[n] quantities stem:[x_1 , x_2 , ... x_n], by the positive square root
    of the mean value of their squares:


    stem:[X_q = ( (1)/(n) ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2 ) )^(1 // 2)]


    .  for a quantity stem:[x] depending on a variable stem:[t], by the positive square
    root of the mean value of the square of the quantity taken over a given interval
    stem:[( t_0 , t_0 + T )] of the variable:


    stem:[X_q = ( (1)/(T) int_( t_0)^( t_0 + T) ( x ( t ) )^2 d t )^(1 // 2)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The root-mean-square value of a periodic quantity is usually taken over an integration
    interval the range of which is the period multiplied by a natural number.
  - The root-mean-square value of a quantity is denoted by adding the subscript q
    to the symbol of the quantity.
  - The abbreviation RMS was formerly denoted as r.m.s. or rms, but these notations
    are now deprecated.
