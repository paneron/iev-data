  definition: 'quotient of blue light hazard weighted radiant flux, stem:[Φ]~B~, and
    luminous flux, stem:[Φ]~v~


    stem:[K_((B ,v)) = ((Phi_B))/((Phi_v)) = ((int Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) *
    B ( lambda ) * d lambda))/((K_m * int Phi_((e , lambda)) ( lambda ) * V ( lambda
    ) * d lambda))]


    where stem:[λ] is wavelength, stem:[Φ]~e,stem:[λ]~(stem:[λ]) is spectral radiant
    flux, stem:[B](stem:[λ]) is the blue light hazard spectral weighting function,
    stem:[V](stem:[λ]) is the CIE <a href="IEV845-21-035">spectral luminous efficiency</a>
    function for photopic vision, and stem:[K]~m~ is maximum luminous efficacy (≈
    683 lm·W^−1^)'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term "luminous radiation" refers to <a href="IEV845-21-002">optical radiation</a>
    weighted with the CIE spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision,
    stem:[V](stem:[λ]).
  - The use of this term is only reasonable if parts of the optical radiation are
    in the visible range and thus stem:[Φ]~v~ ≠ 0.
  - The blue light hazard efficacy of luminous radiation is expressed in watt per
    lumen (W·lm^−1^), possibly with a metric prefix.
