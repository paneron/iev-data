  definition: 'luminous flux emitted within a specified cone angle, stem:[α], determined
    from the luminous intensity distribution, stem:[I]~v~(stem:[θ],stem:[φ]), of the
    light source


    stem:[Phi_((v ,p , alpha)) = int_((phi = 0))^((2 pi)) int_((theta = 0))^((alpha
    // 2)) I_v ( theta , phi ) sin theta d theta d phi]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - (stem:[θ],stem:[φ]) = (0,0) is the direction of the cone axis, which can be coincident
    with the mechanical axis or optical beam axis of the light source or any other
    direction, and should be specified.
  - The cone angle, stem:[α], which can be expressed either in degree (°) or radian
    (rad), is given by the full conic angle and has to be specified, e.g. stem:[Φ]~p,90°~
    or stem:[Φ]~p,π/2~.
  - The term "cone luminous flux" is also used in some applications with the same
    meaning.
  - See also "<a href="IEV845-21-111">useful luminous flux</a>".
  - The partial luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).
