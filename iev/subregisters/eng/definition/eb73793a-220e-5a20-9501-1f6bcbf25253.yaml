  definition: quotient of the diffusely reflected part of the (whole) reflected flux
    and the incident flux
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Reflectance, stem:[ρ], is the sum of regular reflectance, stem:[ρ]~r~, and diffuse
    reflectance, stem:[ρ]~d~: stem:[ρ] = stem:[ρ]~r~ + stem:[ρ]~d~.'
  - The diffuse reflectance has unit one.
