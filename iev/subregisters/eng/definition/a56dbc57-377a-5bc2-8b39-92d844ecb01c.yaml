  definition: production process of superconducting wires which starts with composite
    sheets that are stacked and rolled together to form a cylinder with a spiral cross-section
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A composite is first made of a bronze (Cu-Sn alloy) sheet and a mesh-like plate
    of Nb, wound together concentrically, and then area-reducing processes such as
    wire drawing are done to produce a thin wire, followed by heat-treatment to form
    Nb~3~Sn intermetallic compounds at the interface between Nb and the matrix.
  - The jelly roll process is named the modified jelly roll (MJR) process when a mesh
    component is used instead of a sheet or plate.
  - A similar process is used for Nb~3~Al superconducting wires.
