  definition: 'for a set of stem:[n] magnetic circuit elements forming a magnetic
    circuit, matrix expressing the magnetic fluxes stem:[Φ]~stem:[i]~ in the elements
    in terms of the current linkages stem:[Ө]~stem:[j]~ of the elements:


    stem:[( [[Phi_1],[Phi_2],[vdots],[Phi_n]] ) = ( [[Lambda_((11)),Lambda_((12)),...,Lambda_((1
    n))],[Lambda_((21)),,,vdots],[vdots,,,vdots],[Lambda_((n 1)),...,...,Lambda_((n
    n))]] ) * ( [[Theta_1],[Theta_2],[vdots],[Theta_n]] )]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A permeance matrix is always symmetric and positive definite.
  - In electromagnetism, the permeance matrix can be defined, for a set of closed
    paths, as the matrix expressing linear relations between the magnetic fluxes through
    the surfaces bounded by the paths and the current linkages in the paths.
