  definition: behaviour of a digital television system providing a non-abrupt image
    quality degradation from an unimpaired picture to an unusable picture with decreasing
    signal-to-noise ratio
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Graceful degradation can be achieved by using special forms of digital coding
    and/or modulation providing data streams with different grades of robustness against
    transmission errors.
