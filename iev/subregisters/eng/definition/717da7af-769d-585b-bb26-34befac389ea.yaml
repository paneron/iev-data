  definition: 'for a reluctant element, quotient of the magnetic flux stem:[Î¦] by
    the magnetic tension stem:[V]~m~


    stem:[Lambda = (Phi)/((V_m))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The permeance is the reciprocal of the reluctance.
  - The coherent SI unit of permeance is henry, H.
  - In an electric equivalent circuit, the permeances are represented by conductances,
    magnetic fluxes by electric currents and magnetic tensions by voltages.
