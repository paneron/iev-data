  definition: failures of different items characterized by the same failure mode
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Common mode failures can have different causes.
  - Common mode failures can also be common cause failures ({{IEV 192-03-18, IEV:192-03-18}}).
  - The potential for common mode failures reduces the effectiveness of system redundancy.
