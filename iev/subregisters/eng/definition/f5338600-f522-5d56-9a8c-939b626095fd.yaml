  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the apparent power at
    a point in a transmission channel to the power at the same point after insertion
    of a given two-port device into the transmission channel immediately ahead of
    this point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the insertion loss is less than one, its decibel value is
    negative, and its converse or opposite decibel value called "insertion gain" may
    be used.
