data:
  definition: a function associated with permissive overreach protection whereby fault-detecting
    elements at a section end can operate because the fault level is high but where
    the remote section end infeed is too low to allow operation of the main fault-detecting
    elements such that the remote signal is not sent. Receipt of the signal at the
    weak infeed end, subject to appropriate local conditions being fulfilled, results
    in reflex transmission of the received signal back to the strong infeed end to
    permit tripping at that section end
