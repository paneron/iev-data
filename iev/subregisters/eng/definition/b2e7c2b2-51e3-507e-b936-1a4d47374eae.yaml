  definition: a hypothetical medium such that an external variable electric field
    would produce on its surface an electrical current density vector stem:[vec J]
    which would be tangential to the surface and arbitrarily large in a particular
    frequency band
  examples: []
  notes:
  - It is possible for an anisotropic medium to be a perfect conductor in certain
    directions only; in these directions conductivity may be considered infinite.
