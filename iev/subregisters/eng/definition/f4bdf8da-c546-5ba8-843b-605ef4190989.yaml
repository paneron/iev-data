    \ capable of performing its task in the presence of any single failure\n\nEXAMPLE\n\
    \n\n\n.  Any single detectable failure within the safety systems concurrent with\
    \ all identifiable, but non detectable failures. \n\n.  All failures caused by\
    \ the single failure. \n\n.  All failures and spurious system actions that cause,\
    \ or are caused by, the design basis event requiring the safety function."
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The single failure could occur prior to, or at any time during, the design basis
