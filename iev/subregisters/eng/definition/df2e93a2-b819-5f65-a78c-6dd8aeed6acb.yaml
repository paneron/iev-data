  definition: 'for a reluctant element, quotient of the magnetic tension stem:[V]~m~
    by the magnetic flux stem:[Φ]


    stem:[R_m = ((V_m))/(Phi)]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The reluctance is the reciprocal of the permeance.
  - The coherent SI unit of reluctance is henry to the power minus one, H^–1^.
