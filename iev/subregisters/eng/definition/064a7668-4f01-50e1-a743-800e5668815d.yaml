  definition: spatial beat phenomenon generated by the modulation of numerous spatial
    frequencies
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The sampling of spatially continuous incident patterns by each pixel of an image
    pickup device causes aliasing distortion to appear in the video signal. With a
    video camera, the distortion in the luminance signal is called luminance moiré
    while that in the chrominance signals is called chrominance moiré.
