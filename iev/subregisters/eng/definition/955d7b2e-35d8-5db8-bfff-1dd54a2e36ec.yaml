  definition: quantity of dimension 1 characterizing the relative importance of viscosity
    and thermal diffusivity, defined by stem:[P r = ((eta c_p))/(lambda) = (nu)/(alpha)],
    where stem:[η] is dynamic viscosity, stem:[c]~stem:[p]~ is specific heat capacity
    at constant pressure, stem:[λ] is thermal conductivity, stem:[ν] is kinematic
    viscosity, and stem:[α] is thermal diffusivity
