  definition: volume resistance of a material related to its volume
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For insulating materials the volume resistivity is usually determined by means
    of measuring electrodes arranged on a sheet of the material.
  - 'According to IEC 60050-121: Electromagnetism,“conductivity” is defined as “scalar
    or tensor quantity the product of which by the electric field strength in a medium
    is equal to the electric current density” and “resistivity” as “the inverse of
    the conductivity when this inverse exists”. Measured in this way, the volume resistivity
    is an average of the resistivity over possible heterogeneities in the volume incorporated
    in the measurement; it includes the effect of possible polarization phenomena
    at the electrodes.'
