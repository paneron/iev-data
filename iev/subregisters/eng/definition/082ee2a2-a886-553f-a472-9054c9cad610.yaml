  definition: 'algebraic or vector representation of the match of two colour stimuli,
    of which, for instance, one can be an additive mixture of three reference colour
    stimuli




    In this equation, the sign "≡" indicates a colour match and is read as "matches".
    The unbracketed symbols represent the amounts of the stimuli indicated by the
    bracketed symbols: thus stem:[R]&amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb; means stem:[R] units of
    stimulus &amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb;, and the sign "+" means an additive mixture of
    colour stimuli. In such an equation, a minus sign means that the stimulus is added
    to those on the other side of the equation when the colour match is made.'
  examples:
  - '&amp;lsqb;stem:[C]&amp;rsqb; ≡ stem:[X]&amp;lsqb;X&amp;rsqb; + stem:[Y]&amp;lsqb;Y&amp;rsqb;
    + stem:[Z]&amp;lsqb;Z&amp;rsqb;'
  notes:
  - 'The reference stimuli are represented as &amp;lsqb;R&amp;rsqb;, &amp;lsqb;G&amp;rsqb;
    and &amp;lsqb;B&amp;rsqb; in which case the sign "≡", read as "matches" should
    be used. As an alternative, the colour equation can be written using boldface
    Roman letters when the equal sign "&amp;equals;", read as "equals" should be used:
    *C* = stem:[X]*X* + stem:[Y]*Y* + stem:[Z]*Z*'
