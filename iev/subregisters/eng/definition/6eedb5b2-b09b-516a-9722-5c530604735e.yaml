data:
  definition: a set of points, if it exists, where each of the vectors of a travelling
    sinusoidal electromagnetic wave has the same magnitude at the same instant
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a uniform plane wave, an equi-amplitude surface is orthogonal at each point
    to the imaginary part of the wave vector relative to this point.
