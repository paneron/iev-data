  definition: the velocity vector in a given direction of a moving point associated
    with a sinusoidal travelling wave and defined by a fixed phase of a field quantity
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the direction of propagation, the magnitude of the phase velocity has its minimum
    value;   if no direction is specified, the phase velocity is that in the direction
    of propagation.
