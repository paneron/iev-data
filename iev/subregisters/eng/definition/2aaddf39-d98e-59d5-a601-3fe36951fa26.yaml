  definition: amount by which at a given {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} the {{spot noise
    temperature, IEV:702-08-54}} of a {{one-port, IEV:131-12-64}} connected to the
    input of a given linear {{two-port, IEV:131-12-65}} would have to be increased,
    if the noise due to this two-port were temporarily suppressed, in order to cause
    the noise {{power spectral density, IEV:702-04-50}}, at the output frequency corresponding
    to the input frequency, to be the same as that of the total noise of the one-port
    and the given two-port
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This definition assumes that quantum effects are negligible.
  - The equivalent spot noise temperature of a two-port is dependent on the impedance
    of the one-port connected to its input.
