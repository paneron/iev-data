data:
  definition: voltage to earth appearing on the shield of a specially bonded cable
    when balanced full load currents are flowing in the cable conductors
  examples: []
  notes:
  - When the voltages differ for cables of the three phases, the highest value is
    normally taken into account.
  - Normally quoted at the points along the cable length at which it is maximum (i.e.
    at the unearthed extremity of an elementary section in the case of single point
    bonding and at a cross-bonding point in the case of cross-bonding).
