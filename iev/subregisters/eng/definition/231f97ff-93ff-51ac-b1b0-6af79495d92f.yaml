  definition: the peak value of a prospective current during the transient period
    following initiation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition assumes that the current is made by an ideal switching device,
    i.e. with instantaneous transition from infinite to zero impedance. For circuits
    where the current can follow several different paths, e.g. polyphase circuits,
    it further assumes that the current is made simultaneously in all poles, even
    if only the current in one pole is considered.
