data:
  definition: radiation in which the electric field vector is of constant amplitude
    and rotates about the direction of propagation at a rate equal to the radiation
    frequency
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Circularly polarized radiation is described as right-handed (or left-handed) if
    the rotation of the electric field vector is clockwise (or anticlockwise) as viewed
    by an observer receiving the radiation.
