data:
  definition: difference between the A-weighted sound pressure levels measured at
    different measurement positions and this measured at a reference position downwind
    from the turbine corrected to the same distance from the wind turbine generator
    system rotor center
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The directivity is expressed in decibels.
  - The reference and measurement positions are defined in the relevant standard (i.e.
    IEC 61400-11).
