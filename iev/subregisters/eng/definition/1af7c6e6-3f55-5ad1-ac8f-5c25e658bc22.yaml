  definition: 'ratio of the active frequency region to the resonance frequency


    stem:[D_L = ((f_L - f_r))/((f_r)) tilde= ((C_1))/((2 ( C_0 + C_L )))]


    where


    stem:[f]~r~ is the resonance frequency;


    stem:[f]~L~ is the load resonance frequency;


    stem:[C]~1~ is the motional capacitance;


    stem:[C]~0~ is the shunt capacitance;


    stem:[C]~L~ is the load capacitance'
