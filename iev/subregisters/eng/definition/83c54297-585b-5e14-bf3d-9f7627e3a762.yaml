  definition: 'a criterion which characterizes the degree of roughness of a surface,
    for a given grazing angle of an electromagnetic wave according to the value of
    the quantity:


    stem:[((h sin theta))/(lambda)]


    where


    stem:[h] is the average height of the surface irregularities,


    stem:[θ] is the grazing angle relative to the average surface,


    stem:[λ] is the wavelength'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'In practice, roughness is negligible and the surface is considered specular if:


    stem:[((h sin theta))/(lambda) (1)/((1 0 0))]'
