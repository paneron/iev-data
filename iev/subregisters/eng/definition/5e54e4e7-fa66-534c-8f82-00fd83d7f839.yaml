  definition: sum of durations of all interruptions of supply to individual customers
    served during a time interval, divided by the product of the total number of customers
    served and the duration of that time interval
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If stem:[t]~stem:[ij]~ is the duration of the stem:[i]th interruption of supply
    to customer stem:[j] during a time interval of duration stem:[T], and stem:[N]~S~
    the total number of customers served, then the service unavailability per customer
    served is given by


    stem:[U_((CS)) = ((sum_i sum_j t_((i j))))/((N_S T))]'
  - Only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - If the duration of the time interval is expressed in years, the quantity is called
    the "average yearly downtime per customer served".
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Service unavailability per customer served can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
