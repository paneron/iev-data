data:
  definition: flat conductive surface that is at the same {{electric potential, IEV:121-11-25}}  as
    {{reference ground, IEV:195-01-01}}, which is used as a common reference, and
    which contributes to a reproducible parasitic capacitance with the surroundings
    of the equipment under test (EUT)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A reference-ground plane is needed for the measurements of {{conducted disturbances,
    IEV:161-03-27}}, and serves as reference for the measurement of unsymmetrical
    and asymmetrical {{disturbance voltages, IEV:161-04-01}}.
  - In some regions, the term ‘earth’ is used in place of ‘ground’.
