  definition: the ratio, generally expressed in decibels, of the apparent power at
    a point in a transmission channel after insertion of a given two-port device into
    the path immediately ahead of this point, to the power at this point before insertion
    of the device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If the ratio defining the insertion gain is less than one, its decibel value is
    negative, and its converse or opposite decibel value called "insertion loss" may
    be used.
