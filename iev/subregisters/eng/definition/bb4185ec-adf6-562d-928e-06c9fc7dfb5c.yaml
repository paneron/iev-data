  definition: ratio of the available {{power spectral density, IEV:702-04-50}} of
    the {{noise, IEV:702-08-03}} appearing at a given {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}}
    at the output of a given linear two-port device, to the spectral density which
    would be present at the output if the only source of noise were the {{thermal
    noise, IEV:702-08-45}} due to a {{one-port, IEV:702-09-08}} device connected to
    the input and which is assumed to have at all frequencies a {{spot noise temperature,
    IEV:702-08-54}} equal to the reference {{thermodynamic temperature, IEV:113-04-14}}
    fixed by convention at around 290 K
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The spot noise factor stem:[F](stem:[f]) of a linear two-port device is related
    to the equivalent spot noise temperature stem:[T](stem:[f]) as follows:


    stem:[F ( f ) = 1 + ((T ( f )))/((T_0))]


    where stem:[T]~0~ is the thermodynamic reference temperature.'
  - In English, the term “noise factor” is generally employed when the ratio is expressed
    arithmetically, and “noise figure” is employed when the ratio is expressed in
    {{decibels, IEV:702-07-02}}.
