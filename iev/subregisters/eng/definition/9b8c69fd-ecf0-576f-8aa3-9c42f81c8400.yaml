  definition: occurrence of an accidental conductive path between a live conductor
    and the Earth
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The conductive path can pass through a faulty insulation, through structures (e.g.
    poles, scaffoldings, cranes, ladders), or through vegetation (e.g. trees, bushes)
    and have a significant impedance.
  - A conductive part between a conductor which may, for operational reasons, not
    be earthed and the Earth is also considered to be an earth fault.
