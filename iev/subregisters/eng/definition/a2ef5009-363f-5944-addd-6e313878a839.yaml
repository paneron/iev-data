  definition: the psophometric e. m. f. is twice the psophometric voltage which would
    be measured across a resistance of 600 Ω closing the telephone circuit at the
    point of measurement either directly or by means of an ideal transformer adapting
    the image impedance of the circuit to 600 Ω, the other end of the circuit being
    closed by its image impedance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The psophometric e.m.f. permits the quantitative expression of the degree of interference
    that a disturbing e.m.f. from outside sources would have on a telephone conversation.
