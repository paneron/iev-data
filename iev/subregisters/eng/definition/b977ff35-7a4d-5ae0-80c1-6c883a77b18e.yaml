  definition: process by which the spatial distribution of a beam of radiation is
    changed when it is deviated in many directions by a surface or by a medium, without
    change in {{frequency, IEV:103-06-02}} of its monochromatic components
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A distinction is made between <a href="IEV845-24-050">selective scattering</a>
    and <a href="IEV845-24-051">non-selective scattering</a> according to whether
    or not the scattering properties vary with the wavelength of the incident radiation.
  - The frequency is unchanged only if there is no Doppler effect due to the motion
    of the materials from which the radiation is returned.
  - This entry was numbered 845-04-44 in IEC 60050-845:1987.
