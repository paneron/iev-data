  definition: phenomenon occurring in a physical system when the period of a {{forced
    oscillation, IEV:103-05-05}} is such that the characteristic quantity of the oscillation
    or its time derivative reaches an extremum
  examples: []
  notes:
  - At resonance, the period of the forced oscillation is often close to that of a
    free oscillation.
