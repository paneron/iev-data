  definition: electromagnetic disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device
    or equipment can be resolved into a succession of distinct effects
  examples: []

    of the effect that it produces. As a practical matter, any measure of a disturbance
    should be relatable to its effect on a susceptible device.
