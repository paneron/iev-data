  definition: property of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, determined by the choice
    of a base forming a right-handed trihedron or a left-handed trihedron
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A right-handed base is commonly chosen. If, exceptionally, a left-handed base
    is used for certain purposes, this shall be clearly stated to avoid the risk of
    sign errors.
  - For any stem:[n]-dimensional vector space, the bases can be grouped in two classes
    according to the sign of the determinant of the base vectors relative to a given
    base chosen as reference for space orientation.
