data:
  definition: ratio of the voltage applied between a specified reference point and
    the input terminals, when connected together by a specified circuit, to the voltage
    required between the input terminals to produce the same value of the output
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The common mode rejection ratio is usually expressed in decibels and can depend
    on the frequency, the waveform and the method of measurement.
  - Common mode rejection ratio can also apply to quantities other than voltage.
