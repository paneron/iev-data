  definition: 'the complex quantity <u>stem:[γ]</u> appearing in the equation:


    <u>stem:[a]</u>(t) = Ae^j(ωt - φ) - stem:[γx]^


    where A and <u>stem:[γ]</u> are in principle independent of x, where this expression
    may represent, along a line parallel to the axis Ostem:[x], a component stem:[a(t)]
    of a sinusoidal electromagnetic field at angular frequency ω and initial phase
    φ, especially in the case of guided propagation by means of a cylindrical surface
    parallel to Ostem:[x], or for a uniform plane wave'
