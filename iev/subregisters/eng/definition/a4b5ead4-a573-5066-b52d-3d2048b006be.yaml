  definition: 'quotient of the luminance of a surface element in a specified direction,
    stem:[L]~v,n~, and the luminance of the perfect reflecting diffuser or perfect
    transmitting diffuser identically illuminated and viewed, stem:[L]~v,d~


    stem:[beta_v = ((L_((v ,n))))/((L_((v ,d))))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition holds for a surface element of a non-luminous medium, in a given
    direction and under specified conditions of irradiation.
  - This quantity is also defined spectrally and is called "spectral luminance factor".
  - 'For photoluminescent media, the luminance factor consists of two components:
    the reflected luminance factor, stem:[β]~v,R~, and the luminescent luminance factor,
    stem:[β]~v,L~. The sum of the reflected and luminescent luminance factors is called
    "total luminance factor" and can be expressed by stem:[β]~v,T~: stem:[β]~v,T~ =
    stem:[β]~v,R~ + stem:[β]~v,L~.


    The subscript R is used here for the reflected luminance factor because it is
    more intuitive than the traditional S and avoids confusion with the use of S to
    denote a state of polarization.'
  - The luminance factor has unit one.
