  definition: test signal consisting of a sine squared pulse, the mid-amplitude duration
    of which is Т, where T is the approximate duration of the semi-period corresponding
    to the normal limiting frequency of the video band of the television system under
    consideration
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Other test signals designated 2T...nТ, and consisting of sine squared pulses of
    half amplitude duration of 2T,...nТ.
  - In the case of 625 line systems T is standardized at 0,1 μs.
